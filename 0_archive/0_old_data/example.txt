AB The study of digital economies and the sociology of risk have, with few
   exceptions, a relationship of benign mutual neglect despite possible
   important connections between the two. This article aims to bridge the
   gap between these two fields using Beck's theory of risk society to
   explore how the digital economy's momentum of innovation is generating
   risks and limiting the scope of existing democratic decision-making via
   the power of the digital economy to create social faits accomplis
   outside of democratic control. Three specific risks emerging from the
   dynamics of innovation of digital economies are discussed as vignettes
   to illustrate these developments: (1) the remaking of interpersonal
   co-presence and solitary life; (2) the growing threats of AI to
   intensify unemployment and inequality; and (3) the impact on the
   environment of an always on' and always upgrading' digital communication
   ecosystem. With the gap between the potential and the actual use value
   of the digitalization of the infrastructure of life continuing to grow,
   this article argues that a different relationship between digital
   innovation and private and public spheres needs to be established to
   protect the effectiveness of contemporary democracy.
