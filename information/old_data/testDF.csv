A CONTEXT WHERE DIGITAL CORPORATIONS MOVE INTO HEALTH CARE, PAYERS STRIVE TO KEEP RISING COSTS AT BAY, AND LONGER-LIVING PATIENTS DESIRE CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVED QUALITY OF CARE POINTS TO A DIGITAL AND VALUE-BASED TRANSFORMATION WITH DRASTIC IMPLICATIONS FOR THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR. OBJECTIVE: WE TRIED TO OPERATIONALIZE THE DISCUSSION WITHIN THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR AROUND DIGITAL AND DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION TO IDENTIFY WHAT TYPE OF TECHNOLOGICAL ENABLERS, BUSINESS MODELS, AND VALUE NETWORKS SEEM TO BE EMERGING FROM DIFFERENT GROUPS OF INNOVATORS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONAL EFFORTS. METHODS: FROM THE FORBES 2000 AND CBINSIGHTS DATABASES, WE IDENTIFIED 100 LEADING TECHNOLOGY, LIFE SCIENCE, AND START-UP COMPANIES ACTIVE IN THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR. FURTHER ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED PROJECTS FROM THESE COMPANIES WITHIN A DIGITAL CONTEXT THAT WERE SUBSEQUENTLY EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: DELIVERY OF PATIENT VALUE, PRESENCE OF A COMPREHENSIVE AND DISTINCTIVE UNDERLYING BUSINESS MODEL, SOLUTIONS PROVIDED, AND CUSTOMER NEEDS ADDRESSED. RESULTS: OUR METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH RECORDED MORE THAN 400 PROJECTS AND COLLABORATIONS. WE IDENTIFIED PATTERNS THAT SHOW ESTABLISHED CORPORATIONS RELY MORE ON INCREMENTAL INNOVATION THAT SUPPORTS THEIR CURRENT BUSINESS MODELS, WHILE START-UPS ENGAGE THEIR FLEXIBILITY TO EXPLORE NEW MARKET SEGMENTS WITH NOTABLE TRANSFORMATIONS OF ESTABLISHED BUSINESS MODELS. THEREBY, START-UPS OFFER HIGHER PROMISES OF DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION. ADDITIONALLY, START-UPS OFFER MORE DIVERSIFIED VALUE PROPOSITIONS ADDRESSING BROADER AREAS OF THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR. CONCLUSIONS: DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACCELERATE HEALTH CARE PERFORMANCE BY LOWERING COST AND IMPROVING QUALITY OF CARE. AT AN ECONOMIC SCALE, BUSINESS MODELS CAN BE STRENGTHENED AND DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION MODELS ENABLED. CORPORATIONS SHOULD LOOK FOR COLLABORATIONS WITH START-UP COMPANIES TO KEEP INVESTMENT COSTS AT BAY AND OFF THE BALANCE SHEET.

THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THERMAL HEAT LOSSES THROUGH INSULATION AND AIRTIGHTNESS (IN PARTICULAR IN PRE-1980S HOUSING), UPGRADE THE HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE STOCK (USING THE LATEST ENERGY SAVING MODELS) AND INTEGRATED ON-SITE RENEWABLES AND MICROGENERATION (DEVELOPING A 'PROSUMER' CULTURE AND REDUCING ENERGY BILLS) STILL REMAINS LARGELY UNREALISED. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES IN PROVIDING ADVICE FOR RETROFIT SOLUTIONS TO CONSUMERS WHICH WILL PROMOTE BEHAVIOUR CHANGE AND INFLUENCE PURCHASING DECISIONS. CURRENTLY CONSUMER INFORMATION IS BASED ON STANDARDISED METHODOLOGIES FOR NOMINAL HOUSE TYPES AND THE RESULTING PREDICTIONS OF ENERGY SAVINGS HAVE MINIMAL RESEMBLANCE TO REALITY WHERE THE THERMAL EFFICIENCY OF THE DWELLING, EFFICIENCY OF HEATING SYSTEM AND APPLIANCES, OCCUPANCY, USER BEHAVIOUR AND PREFERENCES WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS AND UPTAKE OF RETROFIT MEASURES. ONE SOLUTION IS TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH PERSONALISED, ACCURATE AND TRUSTWORTHY PREDICTIONS OF ENERGY SAVING MEASURES WHICH ARE CALIBRATED AND TAILORED TO THEIR DWELLING AND LIVING PATTERNS, PRESENTED IN A FORMAT TO ENGAGE AND PROMOTE ACTION. THIS PROPOSAL WILL FACILITATE A WIDESPREAD UPTAKE OF RETROFIT MEASURES IN UK HOMES BY IMPLEMENTING A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO PROVIDING CONSUMERS WITH PERSONALISED, TAILORED RETROFIT ADVICE DELIVERED USING METHODS TO MAXIMISE CONSUMER ENGAGEMENT. SMART HOME TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO USE REAL-TIME MEASUREMENTS, ADVANCED DATA ANALYTICS, DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNIQUES, NOVEL VISUALISATION, SEMANTIC WEB AND CLOUD COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES TO GENERATE ADVICE AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ABSTRACTION FOR INFORMED AND JUSTIFIED DECISION MAKING. THE SMART HOME CONCEPT IS CURRENTLY GAINING SIGNIFICANT MOMENTUM AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN OPEN SYSTEMS, SIMPLE USE AND INSTALLATION FEATURES (IE PLUG AND PLAY), MOBILE ACCESS (IE SMART PHONES) AND CONNECTIVITY HAVE BROUGHT THE CONCEPT TO THE ATTENTION OF ENERGY COMPANIES, ICT COMPANIES AND APPLIANCE MANUFACTURERS. THE IBM VISION OF A SMART(ER) HOME GIVES THREE CHARACTERISTICS: 1) INSTRUMENTED (SENSORS AND AUTOMATION OF HOUSEHOLD ACTIVITIES) 2) INTERCONNECTED (COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DEVICES AND WIDER NETWORKS - ALLOWING REMOTE ACCESS AND CONTROL OF DEVICES) AND 3) INTELLIGENT ('THE ABILITY TO MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON DATA, LEADING TO BETTER OUTCOMES'). SMART HOMES PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR HOMES AND ENERGY SYSTEMS AND, IMPORTANTLY, HOW THEIR ENERGY DEMAND AND COSTS CAN BE REDUCED THROUGH INTERVENTIONS. THIS PROJECT BRINGS TOGETHER A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF BUILDING, ICT, ENERGY, DESIGN AND USER EXPERTS TO DEVELOP A PERSONALISED DECISION SUPPORT PLATFORM FOR BUILDING ENVELOPE RETROFITS, HEATING SYSTEM AND APPLIANCE REPLACEMENT PURCHASES, AND ON-SITE RENEWABLES INTEGRATION. THIS WILL DELIVER A STEP-CHANGE IN THE PROVISION AND ACCURACY OF RETROFIT ADVICE TO UK HOUSEHOLDERS LEADING TO A LOW-ENERGY AND LOW-CARBON FUTURE HOUSING STOCK.

IT IS A SYSTEMIC PHILOSOPHY THAT EMPHASIZES ON FULFILLING CUSTOMER NEEDS, WASTE MINIMIZATION, AND A COMMITMENT TO A CULTURE OF CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT. IN RECENT YEARS, MANY HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS (HEIS) HAVE LEVERAGED ON THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY IN LEARNING AND JUST-IN-TIME TRAINING FOR LEARNERS IN THE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE BOTH THE INTERNAL PROCESSES OF COURSE DELIVERY AND ENHANCE THE PROVISIONS OF EDUCATION QUALITY. IN RECOGNIZING THESE TRENDS IN HEIS, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO IDENTIFY THE KEY FACTORS THAT FACILITATE THE CONVERSION OF PRINTED LEARNING RESOURCES TO E-LEARNING RESOURCES IN A HEI. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THIS STUDY USED A QUALITATIVE EXPLORATORY CASE STUDY APPROACH AND EXAMINED A UNIQUE CASE OF A HEI THAT IS UNDERGOING THE TRANSFORMATION PROCESS FROM PRINTED LEARNING RESOURCES TO DIGITAL SOURCES TO SIMPLIFY THE PROCESSES INVOLVED IN EDUCATIONAL SERVICE DELIVERY AND OPERATIONAL COMPLEXITY. DATA SOURCES INCLUDE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH KEY PERSONNEL DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT OF CONVERTING PRINTED LEARNING RESOURCES TO DIGITAL SOURCES, NOTES TAKEN FROM INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS, AND SECONDARY DATA SUCH AS MINUTES OF MEETINGS, LEARNING RESOURCE ARCHIVES, AND RELEVANT LITERATURE. A RETROSPECTIVE PERSPECTIVE WAS ADOPTED IN THE CASE ANALYSIS SINCE THE HEI HAS ALREADY COMPLETED 50 PERCENT OF THE CONVERSION PHASE WHEN THIS STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT. FINDINGS - ABDUCTIVE REASONING APPROACH AND WELL-ESTABLISHED LEAN PRINCIPLES WERE USED TO MAKE SENSE OF THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION PROCESS OF THE HEI. BASED ON THE RETROSPECTIVE CASE ANALYSIS, THE AUTHORS FOUND EVIDENCE THAT CHARACTERIZES LEAN MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND IDENTIFIES THE CRITICAL FACTORS (CFS) THAT HAVE FACILITATED THE HEI TO ACHIEVE THE KEY MILESTONES IN THE CONVERSION JOURNEY. THESE INCLUDE COMMON VISION, TOP MANAGEMENT SUPPORT AND LEADERSHIP, TIMELY INFORMATION SHARING, AND RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - SINCE THIS RESEARCH IS AN EXPLORATORY CASE STUDY, THE RESULTS OBTAINED CANNOT BE GENERALIZED. FUTURE RESEARCH CAN BE CONDUCTED TO PROVIDE AN IMPACT ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL RISK FACTORS OF A SYSTEM THAT EMPLOYS ONLY THE USE OF E-STUDY MATERIALS. IN ADDITION, FUTURE STUDIES CAN ALSO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF THE LEARNING SERVICES THAT IS SUPPORTED BY THE E-RESOURCES BY GATHERING STUDENT FEEDBACK ON THEIR E-LEARNING EXPERIENCE THAT IS SUPPORTED BY THE ONLINE DIGITAL LEARNING RESOURCES AND LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THIS STUDY PROVIDES MANAGERIAL INSIGHTS INTO THE LEVERS TO ENGENDER THE TRANSFORMATION FROM A TRADITIONAL PRINT LEARNING RESOURCES MODEL TO LEANING WITH DIGITAL E-LEARNING RESOURCES. THE INSIGHTS INTO THE CFS AID EDUCATION MANAGERS TO INTRODUCE PROCESS INNOVATIONS AND ENCOURAGE BEHAVIORAL CHANGES THAT WILL BENEFIT LEARNERS, INSTRUCTORS, AND ADMINISTERS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE STUDY IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO APPLY LEAN MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES IN MAKING SENSE OF THE TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES INVOLVED IN THE USE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION CONTEXT.

MOBILE PHONE TECHNOLOGY OFFERS A SUSTAINABLE MEANS OF ENHANCING SELF-MANAGEMENT OF EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. OBJECTIVE: THIS PAPER AIMS TO DESCRIBE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MOBILE PHONE TOOL DESIGNED TO MONITOR EMOTIONAL CHANGES IN A NATURAL EVERYDAY CONTEXT AND IN REAL TIME. METHODS: THIS EVIDENCE-INFORMED MOBILE PHONE APP MONITORS EMOTIONAL MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, AND IT PROVIDES LINKS TO MENTAL HEALTH ORGANIZATION WEBSITES AND RESOURCES. THE APP OBTAINS DATA VIA SELF-REPORT PSYCHOLOGICAL QUESTIONNAIRES, EXPERIENCE SAMPLING METHODOLOGY (ESM), AND AUTOMATED BEHAVIORAL DATA COLLECTION. RESULTS: FEEDBACK FROM 11 INDIVIDUALS (AGE RANGE 16-52 YEARS 4 MALES, 7 FEMALES), WHO TESTED THE APP OVER 30 DAYS, CONFIRMED VIA SURVEY AND FOCUS GROUP METHODS THAT THE APP WAS FUNCTIONAL AND USABLE. CONCLUSIONS: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCHERS AND DEVELOPERS OF MENTAL HEALTH APPS TO BE USED FOR RESEARCH ARE ALSO PRESENTED.

DESPITE THE RECOGNIZED IMPORTANCE OF KEY USERS DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE OF AN ERP SYSTEM, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR ROLE IN THE ERP USAGE PHASE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - TO PROVIDE RICH INSIGHT IN THE BOUNDARY-SPANNING MECHANISMS UTILIZED BY KEY USERS TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE, A QUALITATIVE APPROACH WAS APPLIED. IN THIS STUDY, ""ABDUCTIVE"" THEME CODING FOR 58 INTERVIEWS WITH KEY USERS, END-USERS AND MANAGERS HAS BEEN USED. THIS PAPER FOUND SIX MECHANISMS AND CHARACTERIZED THEM AS ""CROSSING"" STRUCTURAL, SOCIAL OR COGNITIVE BOUNDARIES. FINDINGS - SIX BOUNDARY-SPANNING MECHANISMS HAVE BEEN DISTINGUISHED WHICH HAVE BEEN APPLIED BY KEY USERS TO OVERCOME SEVERAL KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT ISSUES. SUBSEQUENTLY, THESE MECHANISMS LEAD TO A MODEL WHICH DESCRIBES THREE DIFFERENT ROLES THAT KEY USERS MAY FULFILL TO EFFICIENTLY SHARE AND TRANSFER KNOWLEDGE DURING THE ERP USAGE PHASE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - KNOWLEDGE BARRIERS DURING AN ERP IMPLEMENTATION AND THEIR ACCOMPANYING SIX BOUNDARY-CROSSING MECHANISMS HAVE BEEN DISTINGUISHED. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE RECOGNITION OF THE ESSENTIAL ROLE THAT KEY USERS CAN FULFILL DURING THE USAGE PHASE OF AN ERP SYSTEM IS AN IMPORTANT IMPLICATION. MANAGEMENT HAS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF KEY USERS HAVE TO BE CLEAR FROM THE START AND THEY MAY CAUTIOUSLY SELECT EMPLOYEES WHO ARE SUITED TO BECOME KEY USERS.

WE EXAMINE THE 'BEHIND THE SCENES' INSTITUTIONAL DYNAMICS OF A PUBLIC BODY IN ITS DIGITAL INFORMATION PROVISION (SPECIFICALLY DYNAMIC RIVER LEVEL INFORMATION). BASED ON IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH STAFF ACROSS A LARGE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATOR WE HAVE BROUGHT TO LIGHT FOUR PIVOTAL AREAS OF INSTITUTIONAL DYNAMICS: (1) INSTITUTIONAL PRIORITY AND PATH DEPENDENCY (2) MANAGEMENT AND RESOURCES (3) INSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY AND INTERDEPARTMENTAL DYNAMICS; AND (4) ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO CHANGE. WE GAINED INSIGHT INTO EXPLICIT AND COVERT BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN RELATION TO DIGITAL INFORMATION PROVISION THAT ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN OTHER PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS TOO. BESIDES IDENTIFIED BARRIERS THAT WERE OF A TECHNICAL, STRUCTURAL, MANAGERIAL OR CULTURAL NATURE, ARGUABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT BARRIER WAS CONCEPTUAL, I.E. THE PREVALENCE OF 'EFFICIENCY AND EFFICACY' PERSPECTIVES ON INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (ICT) AMONGST STAFF, IN WHICH ICT IS PRIMARILY PERCEIVED AS A NEUTRAL SOLUTION IN ITSELF TO A WIDE VARIETY OF ISSUES. OPPORTUNITIES WERE NONETHELESS PRESENT IN THE FORM OF ENTHUSIASM AND SOME CRITICAL THINKING ABOUT DIGITAL INNOVATION AMONG STAFF, AND AN EMPHASIS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF STAKEHOLDER INCLUSION IN THE DESIGN OF ICT. WE CONCLUDE THAT THERE IS A NEED TO CONNECT INSTITUTIONAL SOCIAL LEARNING WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF 'CONCEPTUAL PERSPECTIVES' ON ICT, IN WHICH ICT IS NOT SEEN AS A SOLUTION IN ITSELF, BUT AS A SET OF TOOLS IN A WIDER TRANSFORMATIONAL PROCESS, OR AS A LENS TO LOOK AT EXISTING OR NEW PRACTICES.

THE JOINED UP PLATFORM OF TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND ASSOCIATED TRANSFORMATIVE STAFF PRACTICES DEMONSTRATED A WIDE IMPACT ON EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY ACROSS THE ORGANISATION. THE INITIATIVE ADOPTED NEW APPROACHES TO INNOVATION AND CHANGE TO HELP DEAL WITH TWO MAJOR CHALLENGES: 1 ADDRESSING THE TECHNICAL, ORGANISATIONAL AND CULTURAL COMPLEXITY OF SUCH A PROGRAMME OF WORK. 2 ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGE OF LIMITED RESOURCES WITH WHICH TO DELIVER LEAN, PRACTICAL AND USEFUL DIGITAL SOLUTIONS THAT CAN BE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY ADOPTED BY STAFF AND SCALED UP ACROSS THE INSTITUTION. OUR CHALLENGE -MEMBERS OF STAFF USE A DISPARATE SET OF LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES AND DESKTOP SOFTWARE TO CREATE AND DELIVER ASSESSMENTS AND TO MARK WORK AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO STUDENTS. EACH DEPARTMENT AND SCHOOL TENDED TO OPERATE USING A DIFFERENT SET OF PROCEDURES AND FORMS TO ISSUE ASSESSMENTS AND COLLECT SUBMISSIONS, REGISTER PARTICIPATION AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK. THERE WAS NO CLEAR AND CONSISTENT MECHANISM TO RETURN WORK BACK TO STUDENTS OR TO CHECK THE CONSISTENCY AND QUALITY OF FEEDBACK. INDIVIDUAL PRACTICES AND ATTITUDES VARIED AND ACADEMIC STAFF NEEDED TO BE CONVINCED THAT NEW WAYS OF WORKING WOULD BE BETTER FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO ADOPTING AND ACCEPTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES. OUR APPROACH - THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE PRAGMATIC AND AGILE WAY IN WHICH A SMALL TEAM SET OUT TO TRY AND IMPROVE THINGS ONE STEP AT A TIME WITH THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT WERE AVAILABLE TO THEM. THIS INITIATIVE WAS A COMMUNITY DRIVEN ACTIVITY TAKING AN AGILE AND VERY LEAN APPROACH TO CHANGE. IT WAS RECOGNISED THAT CHANGES TO PEDAGOGIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES, AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENT OF A VARIETY OF DIGITAL SOLUTIONS WOULD BE REQUIRED. THE SOLUTION - THE DIGITAL PLATFORM DEVELOPED (CONTAINING 5 COMPONENTS) COMPRISES FEATURES FOR ASSESSMENT PLANNING COMMUNICATION COLLECTING DATA ON SUBMISSIONS COLLATING DATA ON FEEDBACK AND RETURNS USING THE DATA TO PROVIDE ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS IN STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND STAFF PRACTICES SUPPORT A FEEDBACK DIALOGUE BETWEEN MULTIPLE STAFF AND STUDENTS CREATE A DIGITAL PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE UNDERPINNING MULTIPLE ASSESSMENTS, SUBMISSIONS AND FEEDBACK TYPES AND APPLICATIONS THE CREATION OF AN ASSESSMENT AND SUBMISSION DATA STANDARD IN ORDER TO JOIN UP DATA IN DISPARATE SYSTEMS.

THIS SESSION PROVIDES A LOOK AT THE CHANGES BEGINNING TO EMERGE AND A PREVIEW OF WHAT WE THINK EDUCATION CAN AND WILL BE IN THE FUTURE. OVERALL DESCRIPTION: WHAT WOULD PUBLIC EDUCATION LOOK LIKE IF WE INVENTED IT TODAY? CERTAINLY IT WOULD EMBRACE THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH TECHNOLOGY HAS TRANSFORMED HOW WE ALL CREATE, COMMUNICATE, ORGANIZE, SHARE INFORMATION, AND LEARN. TODAY, WITH THE POWER OF TECHNOLOGY, NEW INTEGRATED OFFERINGS AND TOOLS CAN UNITE TEACHER TRAINING AND ASSESSMENT, AND ONLINE CURRICULUM CONTENT FOR EDUCATORS, PARENTS AND ADMINISTRATORS TO SUPPORT AND ENRICH TODAY'S GENERATION OF LEARNERS. IN THIS PRESENTATION, FIONA O'CARROLL, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FOR DIGITAL PRODUCTS RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT AT HOUGHTON MIFFLIN HARCOURT, WILL PROVIDE A LOOK AT THE TRENDS TAKING SHAPE IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND A GLIMPSE OF WHAT THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION CAN LOOK LIKE. KEY DISCUSSION POINTS WILL INCLUDE: HOW GREATER ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGY IS OPENING NEW DOORS FOR TOOLS THAT SUPPORT THE EVOLUTION OF DIGITAL EDUCATION. HOW DIGITAL PLATFORMS AND CURRICULA CAN PROVIDE COGNITIVELY RICH, DIFFERENTIATED TEACHING AND LEARNING RESOURCES THAT BOOST PERSONALIZED LEARNING AND INCREASE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR EDUCATORS TO ENHANCE CLASSROOM CONTENT AND COLLABORATION, AND MAKE CURRICULA AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS AND TEACHERS FROM ONE CENTRAL LEARNING HUB. INTEGRATING DIGITAL CONTENT AS A LEARNING TOOL ACROSS AN ENTIRE SCHOOL DISTRICT, FOR EXAMPLE, TEACHERS AND STUDENTS GAIN UNLIMITED OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOCUSED, EFFICIENT INSTRUCTIONS THAT CONNECT AND ALIGN RESOURCES TO THE DISTRICT BENCHMARKS. A TRUE DISTRICT-WIDE DEMOCRATIZATION OF EDUCATION CAN RESULT. HOUGHTON MIFFLIN HARCOURT IS A GLOBAL EDUCATION LEADER AND HAS BEEN WORKING WITH EDUCATORS ACROSS THE WORLD TO EMBRACE THE WAYS IN WHICH NEW TECHNOLOGIES CAN CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE LEARN AND UNLOCK EVERY CHILD'S POTENTIAL.

WE TRANSLATE LITERATURES OF PADDY AGRICULTURE TO POPULAR CONTENT. SCIENTIFIC VISUALIZATION IS APPLIED TO DEVELOP DIGITAL VALUE-ADDED CONTENT FOR ENHANCING EFFECTS ACCORDING TO COMPUTER GRAPHICS TECHNOLOGIES. FOR DEVELOPING THE INTERNET CHANNEL, WE TAKE WEB-BASED ARCHITECTURE COUPLED WITH JAVA3D AND FLASH VISUALIZATION AS THE MAIN SOLUTION FOR ENGAGING ATTENTION OF VIRTUAL COMMUNITIES. WITH A WEB BROWSER, WE PRESENT PADDY KNOWLEDGE THAT IS BASED ON THE ABOVE-MENTIONED POPULAR CONTENT RELATED TO THREE FUNCTIONS OF RICE PADDIES. FURTHERMORE, FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC, THE TILED DISPLAY WALL IS EMPLOYED TO BUILD UP A FIXED-SITE CHANNEL. IN THIS PAPER, THE DEMONSTRATION OF PROMOTING INTEREST IN PADDY FIELDS HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. THROUGH EXPLORING THIS DIGITAL PADDY, NOT ONLY CHILDREN COULD BE ENCOURAGED TO LEARN, BUT ALSO THE PUBLIC COULD ACCUMULATE THE KNOWLEDGE RELATED TO PADDY AGRICULTURE.","0",2,"0","0","0","2","1611-2490","1611-2504","ISI000208367100008","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ISI",NA,NA,"KUO C C, 2008, "

THIS TECHNOLOGY HELPS FIRMS TO REDUCE TRIAL AND ERROR PROCESS BY SOLVING LATER STAGE PROBLEMS IN EARLIER STAGES. THE DIT BEING THE TECHNOLOGY REFLECTING THE REAL WORLD, AS A TOOL REPRESENTING THE SIMPLIFIED FORM OF THE REAL WORLD, THE DEGREE OF REFLECTING THE REAL WORLD (FIDELITY) IS IMPORTANT IN UTILIZING THE DIT. THIS STUDY IS AN EXPLORATORY RESEARCH EXAMINING THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE FIDELITY OF THE DITS AND DEVELOPING THE COMPLEMENTARY PROCESS NECESSARY FOR UTILIZING THE DIT WITH NOT GOOD ENOUGH FIDELITY. THIS STUDY COULD DRAW OUT, FROM ITS CASE STUDY, AN EXPLORATORY HYPOTHESIS ABOUT THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE COMPLEMENTARY PROCESS. IN THE PROCESS, THERE IS AN ANALYSIS OF THE CORRESPONDING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ACTUAL DATA AND THE OUTPUT DATA OF THE DIT, E.G. SIMULATED RESULT. THEN THE INPUT DATA OR OUTPUT DATA ARE ADJUSTED ON THE BASIS OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE CORRESPONDING RELATIONSHIP SO THAT THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE ACTUAL DATA AND THE EXPECTED INTERPRETATION OF THE OUTPUT DATA, THROUGH THE ADJUSTMENT, OF THE DIT, CAN BE REDUCED. THIS PROCESS IS SOMETIMES ACCOMPANIED BY THE PROCESS OF GENERATING EXPERIMENTAL DATA, WHICH REFLECT THE UNIQUE SITUATION OF THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF A COMPANY, TO BE PUT TO THE DATA BASE OF DIT. THE COMPLEMENTARY PROCESS IS THE PROCESS REQUIRING KNOWLEDGE SHARING AND ADJUSTMENT ACTIVITIES ACROSS DIFFERENT DIVISIONS. THIS STUDY DRAW OUTS IMPLICATIONS FOR EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE FIDELITY OF DIT TOOLS.","0",0,"0","0","0","0","1598-1347",NA,"KJD:ART001308444","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"<U+AE30><U+C220><U+D601><U+C2E0><U+C5F0><U+AD6C>",NA,"<U+C2E0><U+C81C><U+D488> <U+AC1C><U+BC1C><U+ACFC><U+C815><U+C758> <U+B514><U+C9C0><U+D138><U+D654><U+C640> <U+D604><U+C2E4><U+BC18><U+C601> <U+C815><U+D655><U+B3C4> <U+AD00><U+B9AC><U+C5D0> <U+B300><U+D55C> <U+D0D0><U+C0C9><U+C801> <U+C5F0><U+AD6C>",NA,NA,NA,"ISI",NA,NA,"LIM CHAISUNG, 2008, "
