AB The study of digital economies and the sociology of risk have, with few
   exceptions, a relationship of benign mutual neglect despite possible
   important connections between the two. This article aims to bridge the
   gap between these two fields using Beck's theory of risk society to
   explore how the digital economy's momentum of innovation is generating
   risks and limiting the scope of existing democratic decision-making via
   the power of the digital economy to create social faits accomplis
   outside of democratic control. Three specific risks emerging from the
   dynamics of innovation of digital economies are discussed as vignettes
   to illustrate these developments: (1) the remaking of interpersonal
   co-presence and solitary life; (2) the growing threats of AI to
   intensify unemployment and inequality; and (3) the impact on the
   environment of an always on' and always upgrading' digital communication
   ecosystem. With the gap between the potential and the actual use value
   of the digitalization of the infrastructure of life continuing to grow,
   this article argues that a different relationship between digital
   innovation and private and public spheres needs to be established to
   protect the effectiveness of contemporary democracy.

AB There are many obstacles to effective open innovation in the public
   sector context, especially at the "fuzzy front end" (FFE), where the
   need or opportunity is known but serious resources have not yet been
   committed to possible solutions. In this paper, we report on a
   theoretically inspired and practically tested methodology for FFE public
   sector digital innovation. The methodology was purpose-built for the
   context and has been progressively refined using reflection-on-practice,
   but broadly consists of a hybrid of private sector open innovation
   practices, and agile software development processes. We outline the
   background, context, principles, stages and artefacts. Then we evaluate
   the method in terms of barriers and opportunities to FFE public sector
   innovation. We note that establishing the necessary context: a nurturing
   environment; cross-agency commitments in cash and in kind; and boundary
   spanning appointments, is as important to success as is the detailed
   execution of the method.

AB Analyzing "big data" holds huge potential for generating business value.
   The ongoing advancement of tools and technology over recent years has
   created a new ecosystem full of opportunities for data-driven
   innovation. However, as the amount of available data rises to new
   heights, so too does complexity. Organizations are challenged to create
   the right contexts, by shaping interfaces and processes, and by asking
   the right questions to guide the data analysis. Lifting the innovation
   potential requires teaming and focus to efficiently assign available
   resources to the most promising initiatives. With reference to the
   innovation process, this article will concentrate on establishing a
   process for analytics projects from first ideas to realization (in most
   cases: a running application). The question we tackle is: what can the
   practical discourse on big data and analytics learn from innovation
   management? The insights presented in this article are built on our
   practical experiences in working with various clients. We will classify
   analytics projects as well as discuss common innovation barriers along
   this process.

AB Background: Digital innovation, introduced across many industries, is a
   strong force of transformation. Some industries have seen faster
   transformation, whereas the health care sector only recently came into
   focus. A context where digital corporations move into health care,
   payers strive to keep rising costs at bay, and longer-living patients
   desire continuously improved quality of care points to a digital and
   value-based transformation with drastic implications for the health care
   sector.
   Objective: We tried to operationalize the discussion within the health
   care sector around digital and disruptive innovation to identify what
   type of technological enablers, business models, and value networks seem
   to be emerging from different groups of innovators with respect to their
   digital transformational efforts.
   Methods: From the Forbes 2000 and CBinsights databases, we identified
   100 leading technology, life science, and start-up companies active in
   the health care sector. Further analysis identified projects from these
   companies within a digital context that were subsequently evaluated
   using the following criteria: delivery of patient value, presence of a
   comprehensive and distinctive underlying business model, solutions
   provided, and customer needs addressed.
   Results: Our methodological approach recorded more than 400 projects and
   collaborations. We identified patterns that show established
   corporations rely more on incremental innovation that supports their
   current business models, while start-ups engage their flexibility to
   explore new market segments with notable transformations of established
   business models. Thereby, start-ups offer higher promises of disruptive
   innovation. Additionally, start-ups offer more diversified value
   propositions addressing broader areas of the health care sector.
   Conclusions: Digital transformation is an opportunity to accelerate
   health care performance by lowering cost and improving quality of care.
   At an economic scale, business models can be strengthened and disruptive
   innovation models enabled. Corporations should look for collaborations
   with start-up companies to keep investment costs at bay and off the
   balance sheet. At the same time, the regulatory knowledge of established
   corporations might help start-ups to kick off digital disruption in the
   health care sector.

AB Disruptive innovation offers significant promise regarding expedited
   global low-carbon transition, set against currently inadequate efforts.
   In order to appreciate its significance, however, disruptive low-carbon
   innovation must be analysed in the light of three key shifts in
   perspective: to an analysis of system transition and low-carbon
   innovation itself in terms of power/knowledge; to appraisal of the
   significance of digital innovation (similarly reconceptualised) and its
   embryonic convergence with disruptive innovation; and to a geographical
   focus on innovation happening not (just) in locations usually presumed
   as leading in hi-tech, but to developing countries and especially China.
   Indeed, exploring disruptive innovation in this way shows that assenting
   to the commonplace discourse through which Silicon Valley Tech
   innovation is identified as 'disruptive' is to conflate problem with
   solution. Conversely, this approach shows just how significant
   disruptive innovation is likely to prove to low-carbon transition,
   effecting a disruption of innovation itself, and thence of capitalism,
   from which any such transition must ultimately emerge.

AB This paper evaluates smart city (SC) initiatives in the context of
   re-using vacant property, focusing on the role of living labs (LL). LL
   utilise Lo-Fi technologies to foster local digital innovation and
   support community-focused civic hacking, running various kinds of
   workshops and engaging with local citizens to co-create digital
   interventions and apps aimed at 'solving' local issues. Five approaches
   to LL are outlined and discussed in relation to vacancy and
   gentrification: pop-up initiatives, university-led activities, community
   organised venues/activities, citizen sensing and crowdsourcing, and
   tech-led regeneration initiatives. Notwithstanding the potential for
   generating temporary and independent spaces for transferring digital
   competences and increasing citizens' participation in the SC, we argue
   LL foster largely a form of participation framed within a model of civic
   stewardship for 'smart citizens'. While presented as horizontal, open,
   and participative, LL and civic hacking are rooted often in pragmatic
   and paternalistic discourses and practices related to the production of
   a creative economy and a technocratic version of SC. As such, by
   encouraging a particular kind of re-use of vacant space, LLs are used
   actively to bolster the Smart City discourse, as part of the more
   general neoliberalization of urban political economy. We discuss these
   approaches and issues generally, drawing on previous fieldwork and with
   respect to a case study of Dublin, Ireland.

AB Understanding the way information systems grow and change over time and
   the role of different contributors in these processes is central to
   current research on software development and innovation. In relation to
   this, there is an ongoing discourse on how the attributes of software
   platforms influence who can innovate on top of them and the kind of
   innovations possible within the larger ecosystem of technologies and
   people these platforms are part of. This discourse has paid limited
   attention to innovation unfolding in the fringes of the ecosystems
   peripheral to and disconnected from where the central software
   components are developed and where the resources necessary for digital
   innovation are scarce. Drawing upon Zittrain's characteristics of
   generativity and Lane's concept of generative relationships, the key
   contribution of this paper is a socio-technical perspective on
   innovation and generativity in this setting. We build this perspective
   of socio-technical generativity based on a case study of software
   innovation activities in Malawi on top of the health information system
   software platform DHIS2 developed in Norway. This case illustrates how
   the technical attributes of the platform played a key role in concert
   with human relationships in shaping innovation activities in Malawi.

AB People interpret the availability of their mobile phone similar to their
   personal (social) relationships (friends, family, and pets). Hence,
   mobile phones are appliances that provide continuous functional and
   emotional support. Also, in the field of tourism, the integrated use of
   mobile phones is indicated by words such as catalyst' and travel
   buddies', enhancing tourists' experiences. This study goes one step
   further by incorporating the concept of passion and affective outcomes
   of using the mobile phone while travelling. Perceived socialness of the
   mobile phone significantly effects passionate behaviour and affective
   outcomes. For practitioners aiming for digital innovation in the field
   of tourism, these findings provide insight into the development of
   tailor-made travel-related applications. Furthermore, affective feelings
   derived from mobile phone usage will be enhanced by effective
   travel-related applications encouraging the modern tourists while

AB The teaching of media and digital literacies has gained increased
   attention in the 20years following the New London Group's landmark
   publication. From approaches urging the study of popular culture to
   calls for youth led social media revolution, there is no shortage of
   approaches. Yet scant attention is offered toward articulating a new and
   comprehensive theory of pedagogy and production that acknowledges the
   changing tools and technologies at young people's disposal,
   conceptualizes young people as media producers, and applies these
   developments to today's complex classroom context. We aim to articulate
   a new critical theory of multiliteracies that encompasses 4 types of
   digital engagement: (a) critical digital consumption, (b) critical
   digital production, (c) critical distribution, and (d) critical digital
   invention. We make the argument that a new critical theory of
   multiliteracies needs to account for each of these types of digital
   engagement but that, ultimately, we must move beyond theorizing our
   youth as passive consumers or even critical users of digital
   technologies toward the project of facilitating youth communities of
   digital innovation.

AB This paper presents a consensus view on Responsible Innovation by a
   group of industry practitioners, each with high level management
   experience in driving innovation from within industrial companies
   operating in different sectors. The authors argue that, while a
   substantial body of academic research on Responsible Research &
   Innovation (RRI) of potential interest now exists, it is failing to have
   impact in the industrial community, where it is understood to be
   partially targeted, because many of the concepts, tools and
   methodologies are not aligned with current industrial practices. This is
   leading to a misconception as to where industry stands on topics
   addressed by RRI and difficulties in forwarding a dialogue that is
   meaningful to both parties. The need to distinguish between processes
   relating to research and innovation is argued, together with the view
   that research into RRI should encompass more of the on-going work being
   carried out in related fields such as the role of companies in society,
   the debate around Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate
   Shared Value (CSV), responsible digital innovation, the elements of
   ethical leadership, sustainable investment policies and work on
   establishing social impact factors as well as public concerns on
   innovation. Directions for an alignment of the terminology and concepts
   are also proposed. This paper is to be viewed as an attempt at bridging
   perspectives with the aim of finding common ground to develop the field
   of RRI further so that it provides effective concepts, tools and
   methodologies to guide industrial innovation towards better societal
   outcomes.

   asked to create cultural and heritage education courses for primary
   school in training and in service teachers. The two main pillars of the
   DICHE pilot, "MOOCs conception and delivery" and "heritage education",
   are in line with the most recent national and international field
   literature research and with the Italian education system directions,
   aiming at integrating museum education in primary school curricula and a

   Innovation South Africa (DISA)-based laboratory information system (LIS)
   for assessing the prevalence, patterns and trends of antimicrobial
   resistance, and associated demographic factors.
   Methodology: A retrospective analysis was conducted on routine data of
   blood culture isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
   and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These isolates were collected by the
   National Health Laboratory Services between July 1, 2005 and December
   31, 2009 at seven tertiary public hospitals. Factors associated with
   antimicrobial resistance were analysed using multivariate logistic
   regression.
   Results: Information on 9969 isolates was available, of which 3942
   (39.5%), 4466 (44.8%) and 1561 (15.7%) were Staphylococcus aureus,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively.
   Reporting of resistance across antibiotics tested was highest in patient
   age group less than 5 years old. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
   aureus was 39% on average. There was a significant increasing trend of
   Klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to ciprofloxacin (32.6% to 64.9%, p <
   0.001), cotrimoxazole (67.5% to 81.6%, p < 0.001) and
   cefotaxime-ceftriaxone (55.5% to 73.2%, p < 0.001) over the study
   period. Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance to meropenem showed a
   significant increasing trend from 2006 (27.5%) to 2009 (53.9%) (p <
   0.001). Age group < 5 years, female gender, hospital location, year of
   infection were significantly associated with antimicrobial resistance.
   Conclusions: The percentages of antimicrobial resistance were high and
   showed a significant increasing trend among individual agents over the
   duration of the study e.g. ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole among others.
   Continued surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among bloodstream
   hospital-acquired infections should be strengthened.

AB Despite the importance of governance processes for destination
   management and the impact of digital technology on such processes,
   surprisingly little academic research has explored the use of digital
   technology to transform public governance in the tourism sector. This
   conceptual paper fills this gap by conducting a digital government
   stakeholder analysis for the tourism sector using the digital government
   evolution model as its theoretical foundation. The analysis identifies
   six relevant stakeholder groups: governments, businesses, non-profits,
   citizens, visitors and employees. It examines six types of
   technology-enabled interactions between government and other
   stakeholders: government-to-government, government-tobusiness,
   government-to-non-profit, government-to-citizen, government-to-visitor
   and government-to-employee. These interactions are illustrated with
   real-life examples. The analysis contributes to identifying pressures on
   tourism authorities and determining how the authorities respond to such
   pressures, how they innovate their operations and policies with digital
   technologies, and how these innovations are institutionalized over time.
   The results contribute to building the theoretical foundations for
   sector-specific digital government and enable strategic discussion on
   the use of commercially viable and socially responsible digital
   innovation to advance the tourism sector.

AB In light of the fact that firms increasingly use information technology
   (IT) for open innovation initiatives, this paper explores how IT
   investment influences their external search from multiple perspectives:
   breadth, and depth along vertical, horizontal and societal dimensions.
   The basic premise is that IT investment has inverted U-shaped
   relationships with external search breadth and depth. On the one hand,
   IT investment enhances firms' ability to acquire more information from
   external knowledge sources. On the other hand, however, IT investment
   can bring abundant information from external knowledge sources to firms,
   making it increasingly difficult to widely and deeply use the
   information from available sources. Beyond a certain threshold,
   excessive IT investment is likely to cause information overload, forcing
   firms with limited attention to narrow down and go less deeply into
   their external knowledge sources. By using a large-scale panel data set
   from German firms, we find empirical evidence corroborating our theory.

AB Enhanced recovery programmes (ERPs) are increasingly used to improve
   post-surgical recovery. However, compliance to various components of
   ERPs-a key determinant of success-remains sub-optimal. Emerging
   technologies have the potential to help patients and caregivers to
   improve compliance with ERPs.
   Preoperative physical condition, a major determinant of postoperative
   outcome, could be optimized with the use of text messages (SMS) or
   digital applications (Apps) designed to facilitate smoking cessation,
   modify physical activity, and better manage hypertension and diabetes.
   Several non-invasive haemodynamic monitoring techniques and decision
   support tools are now available to individualize perioperative fluid
   management, a key component of ERPs. Objective nociceptive assessment
   may help to rationalize the use of pain medications, including opioids.
   Wearable sensors designed to monitor cardio-respiratory function may
   help in the early detection of clinical deterioration during the
   postoperative recovery and to address 'failure to rescue'. Activity
   trackers may be useful to monitor early mobilization, another major
   element of ERPs. Finally, electronic checklists have been developed to
   ensure that none of the above-mentioned ERP elements is omitted during
   the surgical journey. By optimizing compliance to the multiple
   components of ERPs, digital innovations, non-invasive techniques and
   wearable sensors have the potential to magnify the clinical and economic
   benefits of ERPs. Among the growing number of technical innovations,
   studies are needed to clarify which tools and solutions have real
   clinical value and are cost-effective.

AB Information systems (IS) can foster business transformation toward
   sustainability on a large scale by supporting green technologies,

   fulfil organizational performance requirements and contribute to
   sustainable business practices. These supporting IS provide an
   alternative path to corporate sustainability rather than just
   contributing to the greening' of business practices by aiming to improve
   the organizational performance impact of environmental advantageous
   innovations, which in turn fosters their adoption. Employing a multiple
   case study comprising eight companies that have implemented such
   eco-innovations (specifically electric vehicles) in their business
   processes, our findings indicate that the organizational performance
   contribution of eco-innovations is improved when complemented by
   supporting IS. This effect is achieved by (1) enhancing the efficiency
   of the business processes in which the eco-innovations are deployed,
   thus increasing eco-efficiency, and (2) enabling new functionalities,
   processes and business models that help achieve organizational
   sustainability goals, thereby driving eco-effectiveness. With these two
   aspects, we add two functional affordances - technological flexibility
   and digital eco-innovation - to the existing knowledge base of Green IS
   and point to an elaborated role of IS in sustainability transformation.

AB In an open and digital economy where ICTs, global networks and
   innovation systems play a key economic role, knowledge used by companies
   is increasingly gathered using different external sources. Rapidly
   changing technology enables companies to use new ways to innovate. New
   innovation processes permit companies to reduce risk and the costs of
   innovation. New paradigms, called open innovation and co-innovation,
   allow organizations to remain innovative in a rapidly changing
   environment. The objectives of this paper are: to provide a better
   understanding of open innovation and co-innovation paradigms and to
   suggest instruments for organizations to benefit from co-innovation
   ecosystem.
   Internet empowered ICT tools can be the first step for an organization
   to initiate implementation of a digital strategy. To gain incremental,
   tacit, organizational knowledge or marketing skills, a new innovation
   strategy should involve networking through social networks and virtual
   communities. Digitalization of innovation activities constitutes a new
   important role for innovation networks and ecosystems, including global
   innovation networks, as knowledge and technology are no longer owned by
   a single firm or country. This paper attempts to prepare the theoretical
   background, for empirical studies on the impact of new innovation
   processes on company innovation and their competitive advantages. The
   study is descriptive and analytical, building on the theory and
   empirical results of previous studies on new, digital innovation models.

AB Recently, African economies that withstood the global economic crisis
   out of increased cooperation with China are reeling from the country's
   declining demand for primary commodities, as it shifts to a
   domestic-driven growth model. Consequently, Sino-scepticism has
   rebounded on the premise that the downturn in major African markets is
   an aftermath of the indentured capitalism fuelling China in Africa'.
   However, China and Africa can instrumentalise (inter)dependency in their
   economic engagement, particularly as they undergo unique economic
   transformations. These changes reveal more diverse avenues for
   productive investment and beneficial economic cooperation, and demand
   that both sides place a great deal on appropriate responses to internal
   and externalist adjustments of their economies. In light of China's
   strategic pivot to innovation, it is useful to recommend the exploration
   of the digital innovation economy where Africa is fast gaining global
   recognition. With the promise of cross-cultural cooperation in business
   and technology, the adoption, building and implementation of strategies
   placing innovation as an integral part of China-Africa cooperation, will
   ensure China's investments support Africa's diversification from
   commodities trading more constructively, and in a manner that neatly

AB The nature of shopping activity is changing in response to innovation in
   retailing and the growth in online channels. There is a growing interest
   from transport researchers, policy makers, marketing and retail
   businesses in understanding the implications of this change. However,
   existing tools and techniques developed for analysing behaviour in
   traditional retail environments do not adequately represent emerging
   complexities resulting from digital innovation. In this paper, we
   advance existing destination and mode choice models by incorporating
   online channels in a unified framework. This is a critical extension to
   existing transport literature on destination choice which largely
   ignores online activity. Specifically, we develop discrete choice models
   using elemental store (including both online and in-store) alternatives
   for joint choice of channel, store, and travel mode. We demonstrate the
   use of a widely-accepted consumer panel dataset with minor
   modifications, for the first time in transport research, together with
   API based data mining tools that offer great potential for enrichment.
   The analysis focuses on grocery shopping and uses consumer data
   collected from two selected boroughs in London; results from multinomial
   logit and nested logit estimations are reported. The extension presented
   here provides the tools to quantify the effects of increased online
   shopping on traditional store formats and travel patterns. Our results
   showed virtual alternatives currently offer an attractive substitute
   among early adopters for large basket shopping mostly for high income
   groups. This might suggest a significant reduction in shopping trips to
   hypermarkets often associated with large basket shopping potentially
   leading to store closures. Online deliveries mostly draw from driving
   trips and less so from walking and public transport trips. The present
   study also confirmed previous findings related to smaller stores and
   longer travel distances being associated with declining utilities,
   agglomeration and competition significantly influencing store choice.

AB Digital innovation is becoming increasingly important in today's
   economy. Many digital innovations are developed not within
   organizations, but in innovation-driven entrepreneurial ecosystems,
   where various entrepreneurship related stakeholders collaborate and
   cooperate. Despite its significance, studies on digital entrepreneurship
   ecosystems (DEEs) are limited and the concept is largely undertheorized.
   This study intends to fill that gap by studying how a DEE organizes.
   This organizing issue is challenging, because stakeholders of a DEE are
   self-organizing and are not governed by any formal authority. To answer
   that question, we adopt forms of organizing as a theoretical lens, which
   provides structure to examine organizing issues. Through an in-depth
   case study of Zhongguancun, the Silicon Valley of China, we unveil eight
   processes around the themes of division of labor and integration of
   efforts. We further show that the forms of organizing feature a balance
   of centralized design and de-centralized emergence. This balanced view
   extends the forms of organizing literature, which takes an either/or
   perspective. Ecosystem architects and policy makers who intend to build
   entrepreneurship ecosystems to promote local economies can derive
   practical implications from our findings.

AB The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) is the first trade
   agreement that comprehensively deals with contemporary policy issues in
   digital trade. It introduces new disciplines on issues such as
   cross-border data flows, online privacy, network neutrality,
   cybersecurity, regulation of spam, and safe harbour protection for
   internet intermediaries. These provisions are atypical of trade
   agreements, and are particularly significant as they have a direct
   impact on internet policy. In this article, I evaluate these new
   disciplines in the TPP to assess the extent to which the TPP is suitably
   placed in the internet eco-system. After a comprehensive legal
   assessment of these disciplines, I argue that the TPP does not
   effectively fit into the broader internet ecosystem, as it fails to
   synergize the goal of trade liberalization with important internet
   policy concerns such as facilitating trust of internet users and digital
   innovation. However, despite its deficiencies, the TPP sets a new
   benchmark for rules on digital trade, as its provisions address several
   contemporary issues in the digital economy. Therefore, the provisions on
   digital trade within the TPP will be instrumental in future negotiations
   at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other regional bodies. More
   importantly, the TPP is a reminder of the increasing significance of
   trade agreements in influencing critical aspects of internet policy.
   Particularly, in developing rules on digital trade that affect issues
   such as cross-border data flows, online privacy and consumer protection,
   net neutrality and cybersecurity, trade negotiators/lawyers need to
   comprehensively assess the relevance of these rules in the
   liberalization of digital trade, and its broader impact on the internet
   ecosystem.

   theorizing on digital innovation management that does not rely on such
   assumptions and draws on the rich and rapidly emerging research on
   digital technologies. We offer suggestions for such theorizing in the
   form of four new theorizing logics, or elements, that are likely to be
   valuable in constructing more accurate explanations of innovation
   processes and outcomes in an increasingly digital world. These logics
   can open new avenues for researchers to contribute to this important
   area. Our suggestions in this paper, coupled with the six research notes
   included in the special issue on digital innovation management, seek to
   offer a broader foundation for reinventing innovation management
   research in a digital world.

AB Past research provides instructive yet incomplete answers as to how
   incumbent firms can address competing concerns as they embrace digital
   innovation. In particular, it offers only partial explanations of why
   different concerns emerge, how they manifest, and how firms can manage
   them. In response, we present a longitudinal case study of Volvo Cars'
   connected car initiative. Combining extant literature with insights from
   the case, we argue that incumbent firms face four competing
   concerns-capability (existing versus requisite), focus (product versus
   process), collaboration (internal versus external), and governance
   (control versus flexibility)-and that these concerns are systemically
   interrelated. Firms must therefore manage these concerns cohesively by
   continuously balancing new opportunities and established practices.

AB How do IT-enabled capabilities influence firms' ability to leverage
   customer involvement and shape the amount of firm innovation? This study
   theorizes that effective processing and management of customer
   information flows requires organizations to possess "relational
   information processing capability" (RIPC) and "analytical information
   processing capability" (AIPC). Drawing on and extending the theories of
   absorptive capacity and complementarities in the context of innovation,
   we posit that RIPC and AIPC complement product-focused customer
   involvement (PCI) and information-intensive customer involvement (ICI)
   practices, respectively, to enhance the amount of firm innovation. To
   test our hypotheses, we collected archival data from more than 300 large
   U.S. manufacturing firms and mapped their RIPC and AIPC to specific IT
   applications.
   Consistent with our theorizing, we find that RIPC positively moderates
   the relationship between PCI and amount of firm innovation and that AIPC
   positively moderates the relationship between ICI and amount of firm
   innovation. In further exploratory analysis, we find a positive
   three-way interaction between AIPC, RIPC, and PCI. Taken together, the
   results suggest that configurations of IT-enabled capabilities alone are
   not enough for innovation; instead, firms benefit more when specific
   configurations of IT-enabled capabilities are leveraged in unison with
   specific types of customer involvement. The study contributes to theory
   and practice by shedding light on important complementarities between
   specific types of customer involvement (PCI and ICI) and specific
   IT-enabled capabilities (RIPC and AIPC).

AB Digital ventures, start-ups growing by drawing on and adding to digital
   infrastructures, can scale their business at an unprecedented pace. We
   view such rapid scaling as a generative process by which a venture's
   user base increases significantly between two points in time through
   digital innovation. We studied WeCash, a Chinese digital venture, nearly
   doubling its user base monthly, to learn more about this generative
   process. We trace three contingent mechanisms underpinning rapid
   scaling: data-driven operation, instant release, and swift
   transformation. We explain these mechanisms and how they interact in the
   rapid scaling of digital ventures. The research offers an agency
   perspective on scaling of digital ventures that speaks to the digital

AB Theories of knowledge reuse posit two distinct processes: reuse for
   replication and reuse for innovation. We identify another distinct
   process, reuse for customization. Reuse for customization is a process
   in which designers manipulate the parameters of metamodels to produce
   models that fulfill their personal needs. We test hypotheses about reuse
   for customization in Thingiverse, a community of designers that shares
   files for three-dimensional printing. 3D metamodels are reused more
   often than the 3D models they generate. The reuse of metamodels is
   amplified when the metamodels are created by designers with greater
   community experience. Metamodels make the community's design knowledge
   available for reuse for customization-or further extension of the
   metamodels, a kind of reuse for innovation.

AB Mathematics is a fundamental skill in many aspects of a student's life.
   Most students everywhere, and in this study in Brazil, sometimes lack
   motivation to thrive in such subjects. The work presented in this paper
   aims to contribute to the development of a multiplatform teaching and
   learning application through the use of Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICT), in order to encourage the study of mathematics from
   the first years of basic education. The activities are divided into two
   areas: training teachers and how to integrate technology in the
   classroom through the use of mobile learning. The experience was
   conducted with children from the 5th grade, teaching them fractions and
   mathematics concepts all as part of a research project called
   "Technology Integration Proposal in Teaching STEM Disciplines in Public
   Basic Education", supported by CNPq - the Brazilian National Council for
   Scientific and Technological Development, and the project "Use of Remote
   Experimentation on Mobile Devices for Basic Education in Public Schools"
   supported by FRIDA (Regional Fund for Digital Innovation in Latin
   America and the Caribbean). In 2011, this project was selected as one of
   the most innovative research projects in Brazilian education by the
   Institute for Development and Educational Innovation (IDIE) of the
   Organization of Ibero-American States for Education, Science and Culture
   (OEI) and sponsored by FundaciOn Telefonica.

AB Indian agriculture sector accounts for 13.9 per cent of India's gross

   workforce. ICT tools are common these days to support agriculture
   sector. Close to 46.000 farm graduates were trained on ICT between 2002
   and 2016, more than 19.000 ventures begun till 2016 in this sector and
   currently 25 Kisan call centers (farmer hotline) are located in
   different parts of the country utilizing ICT. In spite of so much ICT
   interventions, farmers are still at bottom of economic and social
   pyramid in India. The project CCKN-IA (Climate Change Knowledge network
   in Indian Agriculture implemented by the German Development Cooperation
   - GIZ) has made an attempt to identify lacunas and multiple needs of the
   farmers and come up with a unique, innovative and pragmatic idea to

AB Purpose - Collecting Institutions in the Network Society is a
   multidisciplinary PhD study examining present practices and policies of
   collecting institutions (museums, galleries, libraries and archives) in
   their use and development of digital technologies, within the context of
   wider socio-technical change. It investigates whether existing service
   paradigms are best suited to future digital delivery of services in the
   emergent network society.
   Design/methodology/approach - It uses an interpretive methodological
   approach creating a body of phenomenological evidence enabling
   comparison between the organisational context, internal practices,
   histories and policies of collecting institutions, and the wider
   socio-technical impact of the internet. Literature reviews provide
   evidence from the "outer world" of internet developments and impact to
   establish four generic drivers of internet change. For the "inner world"
   of collecting institutions, organisational context and research and
   development on innovation are examined to analyse various perspectives
   on common approaches to service policy and practice. Additionally,
   textual analysis of institutional mission statements and policy
   documents is used to establish the degree of common purpose across
   collecting institutions and the preparedness of practitioners and
   policymakers to deal with rapid socio-technical change.
   Findings - The evidence is synthesised to define an institutional
   paradigm describing the present operational processes and practices of
   collecting institutions. This is compared with the four generic drivers
   to define opportunities and challenges that collecting institutions face
   in exploiting the internet. This synthesis demonstrates that the
   siloised and fragmented nature of the institutional paradigm creates
   significant barriers to effective exploitation. Evidence from the
   textual analysis is used to develop a shared mission statement for all
   collecting institutions as the foundation of a strategic digital future.
   Originality/value - The study proposes a radically new service paradigm
   (the digital knowledge ecology) enabling collecting institutions to
   achieve maximum user value in their delivery of digital services, and
   concludes with proposals for actions to build a collective strategy.

AB This chapter introduces open digital innovation contests that aim to
   develop digital services. Key stakeholders in such contests are
   identified: organisers, participants, resource providers, and
   beneficiaries. A classification of digital innovation contests is
   proposed based on the length of a contest and its inclusiveness. Other
   design elements of contests are also discussed, including media, target
   group and evaluation. It is argued that innovation contests can be
   viewed as innovation intermediaries that help to connect actors in an
   innovation system. Advantages and disadvantages of innovation contests
   are discussed. Finally, six contests are introduced, which serve as
   running examples throughout the book.
   Open digital innovation contests are competitions that aim to develop
   digital services. Based on the work by Hjalmarsson and Rudmark (2012),
   they can be described as events in which external developers compete to
   design and implement innovative and solid digital service prototypes,
   based on digital resources made available by the organiser. There are
   three key ingredients in this definition. First, the participants of the
   contests are to be external developers, i.e. developers outside the
   organisation that arranges the competition. In this way, new categories
   of people are drawn into the innovation system around an organisation,
   thereby enabling open innovation. Furthermore, the goal is to develop a
   digital service prototype; it is not sufficient just to suggest a new
   idea or create a product without digital content. Finally, the service
   developed is to be based on digital resources made available by the
   organiser.

   innovation contests. The method serves several purposes: it helps to
   evaluate whether the organisers have achieved their goals of organising
   the contest or not, it supports managers in managing the contest
   operations and it supports learning within the organisations. The
   activity also supports knowledge transfer to other organisations and
   supports making contributions to the scientific knowledge base. The
   method description is followed by an example and a few guidelines.

AB On a global scale, programmes of social protection for the poor are
   becoming increasingly computerised, and architectures of biometric
   recognition are being widely used in this respect. I research how these
   architectures, adopted in anti-poverty systems, structure ways to 'see
   the state' for citizens living in poverty. To do so I study India's
   Public Distribution System (PDS) in Kerala, which is augmenting its main
   food security scheme with the computerised recognition of its users. In
   the government's narrative, biometric technology is depicted as an
   optimal solution to the illicit diversion of PDS goods on the market.
   Nevertheless, according to the multiple narratives collected across the
   state, beneficiaries dispute this view in different ways because of the
   mixed effects of the new technology on their entitlements under the PDS.
   The government's capability to reconstruct its image through digital
   innovation is thus found to be constrained by citizens' perceptions
   derived from their encounters with the new technology of governance.

AB Cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, is a digital currency in which encryption
   techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and
   verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.
   It is an emerging financial technology enabled by innovation,
   increasingly popular among global Internet users, and more
   interestingly, it challenges the existing financial and regulatory rules
   on the currency and payment systems of the world today. On the other
   side, certain cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, have been actively used as
   payment tools for illicit transactions. Both the "promising" and
   "challenging" faces of cryptocurrency trigger causes for concern for
   policy makers, not only from financial sector, but also legal and
   technological sectors. The decentralised nature of cryptocurrency
   creates unique problems for the government to regulate or impose any
   regulatory requirements. This article argues that, in order for Malaysia
   to remain at the forefront of financial and digital innovation, it is
   timely to look at the question on whether to formulate certain policy
   and regulatory framework on the use of cryptocurrency in Malaysian
   market. The answer can pave the way for Malaysian digital citizens to
   potentially grab the opportunities made possible by the cryptocurrency
   technology. For this purpose, the researchers seek to study the features
   of cryptocurrency and the experiences from policymakers in other
   jurisdictions in dealing with the matter.

AB International Business Machines (IBM) points out that academics and
   industries pay a higher attention on "Service Science" since 1985. With
   the rotation of the wheel of a service era, many companies has driven
   from production to service-orientation, and focus on manufacturing
   services field. In the past, high-tech companies with leading
   technologies and unique products were ahead of other companies, but
   nowadays, this pattern is changed due to the changing market
   environment, consumption and other factors. In order to attract
   customers and to continue a leading position at the market, companies
   require to have service innovation infrastructure. This study focuses on
   enhancement of service innovation goal by professional managers'
   entrepreneurship for high-tech companies in Hsinchu Science Park and
   Silicon Valley areas.
   Initially, in accordance with the purpose of the study, relevant
   literatures integrated from domestic and international journals to
   develop the draft questionnaire. Then, a survey was conducted at Hsinchu
   Science Park and Silicon Valley by the participation of 12 experts to
   finalize the content of the questionnaire. Third, the pilot
   questionnaire survey sent out to 250 participants (200 in Hsinchu
   Science Park and 50 in Silicon Valley) through e-mail and internet
   platform. Finally, the statistical software is used analyze multivariate
   regression.
   Findings state that the personality (PersA) of Entrepreneurial
   Orientation to Service Innovation (InnV) no significant correlation. The
   personality (PersB) to InnV have significant correlation. When PersA
   integrated environment (Env) to InnV generated significant positive
   correlation; PersB integrated Env to InnV got strong positive
   correlation. Consequently, environment factor hold on intermediary
   efficient results. PersA integrated Organizational Factor (OrgV) have
   significant correlation but only increase a little coefficient value.
   PersB integrated OrgV have significant correlation but decrease the
   coefficient value. Consequently, this study demonstrates that OrgV
   doesn't have an intermediary efficient result.
   The result of the analysis is useful for decision - makings of top
   managers, when they adopt service innovation in these two Science Park.
   Moreover, results provide theoretical contribution for academicians for
   their future academic reports.

AB The 4th Industrial Revolution is a new wave of digital innovation.
   Driverless cars, smart robotics, internet of things (IoT), and other
   technological changes are happening in our daily life. The notion of
   smart cities is closely related to the new industrial revolution. We
   might think of the emergence of smart cities as the realization of the
   4th industrial revolution in the spatial context. Many cities around the
   world are preparing to be smart cities via urban regeneration. In
   recognizing these changes, this paper tries to understand what the new
   industrial revolution brings to us, how the new digital revolution acts
   in our cities, and how urban regeneration can utilize the advent of the
   new wave of the groundbreaking innovation.This study illustrates why
   smart technologies are necessary in the urban regeneration process, and
   what the opportunities and threats in the decentralized and
   self-generating framework in the new era. We observe that the top-down
   decision-making procedure might be inefficient. Equally, the fully
   decentralized and fragmented system will increase the level of risk in
   the urban regeneration projects. The key element of success is the
   capacity of the central and local government to build the communication
   infrastructure and to facilitate the interplay among the participation
   in the projects.

   the use of smart home technologies and their potential impact on
   household energy demand.As part of the REFIT project, a national survey
   was conducted to measure perceptions of smart homes. The survey
   instrument was developed and tested by the project team. The survey was
   implemented online during September - October 2015 by a market research
   company using a representative sample of UK homeowners. A total of 1054
   responses were collected. The survey responses were coded and cleaned by
   the project team. Both survey instrument and cleaned response data are
   made available here.The REFIT project additionally ran a field trial of
   smart home technologies involving twenty households in Loughborough, UK,
   over a two year period from October 2013 - October 2015. Detailed
   qualitative data on participating households perceptions of smart home
   technologies are available separately (see Related resources - Related
   data collections).These data were collected as part of the REFIT project
   (`Personalised Retrofit Decision Support Tools for UK Homes using Smart
   Home Technology). The REFIT project ran from 2012 - 2015 as a consortium
   of three universities - Loughborough, Strathclyde and East Anglia - and
   ten industry stakeholders. The REFIT project was funded by the
   Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through
   linked grants under the Transforming Energy Demand in Buildings through

   http://www.refitsmarthomes.orgProject description:Thermal efficiency
   retrofit options, appliance upgrades and on-site renewables represent a
   significant opportunity to deliver energy demand reductions to UK homes.
   The potential to reduce thermal heat losses through insulation and
   airtightness (in particular in pre-1980s housing), upgrade the household
   appliance stock (using the latest energy saving models) and integrated
   on-site renewables and microgeneration (developing a 'prosumer' culture
   and reducing energy bills) still remains largely unrealised. There are a
   number of challenges in providing advice for retrofit solutions to
   consumers which will promote behaviour change and influence purchasing
   decisions. Currently consumer information is based on standardised
   methodologies for nominal house types and the resulting predictions of
   energy savings have minimal resemblance to reality where the thermal
   efficiency of the dwelling, efficiency of heating system and appliances,
   occupancy, user behaviour and preferences will have a significant impact
   on the effectiveness and uptake of retrofit measures. One solution is to
   provide consumers with personalised, accurate and trustworthy
   predictions of energy saving measures which are calibrated and tailored
   to their dwelling and living patterns, presented in a format to engage
   and promote action. This proposal will facilitate a widespread uptake of
   retrofit measures in UK homes by implementing a holistic approach to
   providing consumers with personalised, tailored retrofit advice
   delivered using methods to maximise consumer engagement. Smart Home
   technology provides a unique opportunity to use real-time measurements,
   advanced data analytics, digital signal processing and communications
   techniques, novel visualisation, semantic web and cloud computing
   technologies to generate advice at different levels of abstraction for
   informed and justified decision making. The Smart Home concept is
   currently gaining significant momentum and new developments in open
   systems, simple use and installation features (ie plug and play), mobile
   access (ie Smart Phones) and connectivity have brought the concept to
   the attention of energy companies, ICT companies and appliance
   manufacturers. The IBM vision of a Smart(er) Home gives three
   characteristics: 1) Instrumented (sensors and automation of household
   activities); 2) Interconnected (communication between devices and wider
   networks - allowing remote access and control of devices); and 3)
   Intelligent ('the ability to make decisions based on data, leading to
   better outcomes'). Smart Homes provide consumers with more control over
   their homes and energy systems and, importantly, how their energy demand
   and costs can be reduced through interventions. This project brings
   together a multi-disciplinary team of building, ICT, energy, design and
   user experts to develop a personalised decision support platform for
   building envelope retrofits, heating system and appliance replacement
   purchases, and on-site renewables integration. This will deliver a
   step-change in the provision and accuracy of retrofit advice to UK
   householders leading to a low-energy and low-carbon future housing
   stock. The outcomes will be of benefit to: energy, ICT, embedded systems
   and telecommunication companies developing technology and business
   models for Smart Home services; consumers to lower their energy bills
   and improve the safety, security and comfort of their homes; building
   component, boiler and appliance manufacturers developing the next
   generation of low-energy products; and policy makers for new insights
   into innovative approaches to meeting the security, affordability and
   carbon reduction aspirations of the UK energy system. Copyright: Charlie

AB The Industry 4.0 is the industrial revolution based on
   Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPS) in the context of Factory of Future. The
   digital innovation is not an exclusivity of new and advanced technology
   and production processes. The traditional production processes and
   plants are evolving following this digitalization combining the long
   experience and the new fast methods to improve the production
   efficiency, to accelerate the fine-tuning and real-time adjustment of
   the process parameters oriented to the zero defect quality.
   Manufacturing current trends show an improvement in demand for light
   products considering the material substitution for complex structural
   parts, the design and technology innovation as well as the evolution in
   smart production. Due to the high number of process variables involved
   and to the non-synchronisation of all process parameters in a unique and
   integrated process control unit, High Pressure Die Casting (HPDC) is one
   of the most "defect generating" and "energy-consumption" processes in EU
   industry showing less flexibility to any changes in products and in
   process evolution. In both, sustainability issue imposes that
   machines/systems are able to efficiently and ecologically support the
   production with higher quality, faster delivery times, and shorter times
   between successive generations of products.
   The FP7-MUSIC project (funded in the frame of the Call FoF-ICT-2011.7.1
   Smart Factories: Energy-aware, agile manufacturing and Customization) is
   giving a new age to the traditional multi-stages production processes
   such as High Pressure Die Casting (HPDC). The use of sensors, the
   totally integrated systems, as well as the data mining and cognitive
   model are the key ingredient of the MUSIC project to be a reference in
   the Industry 4.0 context.

AB Purpose - Lean is considered as a major management approach for
   improving operational productivity and organizational performance. It is
   a systemic philosophy that emphasizes on fulfilling customer needs,
   waste minimization, and a commitment to a culture of continual
   improvement. In recent years, many higher education institutions (HEIs)
   have leveraged on the use of technology to provide flexibility in
   learning and just-in-time training for learners in the efforts to
   improve both the internal processes of course delivery and enhance the
   provisions of education quality. In recognizing these trends in HEIs,
   the purpose of this paper is to identify the key factors that facilitate
   the conversion of printed learning resources to e-learning resources in
   a HEI.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used a qualitative exploratory
   case study approach and examined a unique case of a HEI that is
   undergoing the transformation process from printed learning resources to
   digital sources to simplify the processes involved in educational
   service delivery and operational complexity. Data sources include
   semi-structured interviews with key personnel directly involved in the
   project of converting printed learning resources to digital sources,
   notes taken from informal discussions, and secondary data such as
   minutes of meetings, learning resource archives, and relevant
   literature. A retrospective perspective was adopted in the case analysis
   since the HEI has already completed 50 percent of the conversion phase
   when this study was carried out.
   Findings - Abductive reasoning approach and well-established lean
   principles were used to make sense of the digital transformation process
   of the HEI. Based on the retrospective case analysis, the authors found
   evidence that characterizes lean management principles and identifies
   the critical factors (CFs) that have facilitated the HEI to achieve the
   key milestones in the conversion journey. These include common vision,
   top management support and leadership, timely information sharing, and
   relationship management with key stakeholders in the transformation
   processes.
   Research limitations/implications - Since this research is an
   exploratory case study, the results obtained cannot be generalized.
   Future research can be conducted to provide an impact analysis of the
   potential risk factors of a system that employs only the use of e-study
   materials. In addition, future studies can also assess the quality of
   the learning services that is supported by the e-resources by gathering
   student feedback on their e-learning experience that is supported by the
   online digital learning resources and learning management system.
   Practical implications - This study provides managerial insights into
   the levers to engender the transformation from a traditional print
   learning resources model to leaning with digital e-learning resources.
   The insights into the CFs aid education managers to introduce process
   innovations and encourage behavioral changes that will benefit learners,
   instructors, and administers.
   Originality/value - The study is one of the first to apply lean
   management principles in making sense of the transformation processes
   involved in the use of digital innovation in higher education context.
   The findings provide a holistic view of the process transformations.

AB In the era of AI, all societal area including education will change with
   new digital technology. Thinking with the educational environment,
   emergence of the highly ‘intelligent’ machine shall be the most
   innovative medium for educational development to teachers, students and
   others. Otherwise, digital divide derived from the inequal access to
   digital divide, different digital knowledge and literacy, and short of
   digital democracy is pointed out as the overwhelming challenge to
   overcome for the educational minority in this digital era. However,
   surely, digital innovation deserves to be celebrated as new momentum for
   educational innovation not only on its own contents’ quality and style;
   but also on its new movement to open and share.This study reviews the
   causes and momentum upon OER movement; for sharing culture on education
   field; from primay to higher education field. Those OER cases have risen
   as progress of educational technology, rise of open culture and contents
   movement, and innovative marketing and societal contribution of
   universities; MOOC. Open Educational Resource (OER); what changes OER
   now draws on existing education ecosystem so far; and where OER goes
   here after based on its own potential and controversies to be concerned.
AK 본 연구는 인공지능 시대에 디지털 접근성의 차이로 유발되는 디지털 격차가 연쇄작용으로 교육격차의 심화를 가져온다는 데 문제의식을
   두었다. 이에 본 연구는 인공지능 시대의 교육 불평등에 대한 교육생태계의 대응책으로서 공유와 개방의 열린교육자원(Open
   Educational Resources: OER)이 가지는 대안적 가능성을 탐색하고자 하였다. 이를 위하여 먼저, OER이
   등장하게 된 배경 및 현황을 교육계 내부의 수요, 공유문화 운동의 확산, 고등교육을 중심으로 전개된 무료공개강좌의 온라인 플랫폼
   구축을 중심으로 검토하였다. 다음으로 OER의 여러 사례로서, 국내외 초중등 및 고등교육 현장에 도입된 OER과 관련한 쟁점들을
   분석하였다. 본 연구의 기대효과는 다음과 같다. 먼저 디지털 격차로 야기되는 교육 불평등에 대한 대안으로서 디지털기술의 순기능과
   잠재력을 살린 OER을 활용하는 방향을 제시하고, 궁극적으로는 OER을 도입하기 위한 방안 마련 및 정책 수립의 기초자료로 활용될
   수 있을 것으로 기대한다.

AB A good deal of research and practice on digital innovation public sector
   projeCts takes for granted a stability change dichotomy which positions
   these two phenomena as opposite and difficult to conciliate. In this
   area There is a shortage of studies focusing on how projects as the main
   vehicles for digital innovation could mediate between change and
   stability in the public sector. To address this gap this paper proposes
   Discursive Institutionalism (DI) to better understand the dynamics of
   this type of projects. A case study of a multi-actor project in the
   Albanian context extends the scope of the analysis to the transitional
   institutional environment in which the project unfolded. Findings
   suggest that large-scale multi-actor digital innovation public sector
   projects can not only be seen as temporary endeavors but also as
   strategic points of interaction for multifaceted stakeholders whose
   ideas and discourses could converge at levels of policies, programs and
   philosophies in order to keep required stability in the face of change.
   Using DI, a number of propositions are formulated and empirically
   validated to draw insights and implications for future project policy
   formulation, research and practice. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Modern science has become collaborative and digital. The Internet has
   supported the emergence of scientific digital platforms that globally
   connect programmers and users of novel digital scientific products such
   as scientific interactive software tools. These digital scientific
   innovations complement traditional text-based products like journal
   publications. This article is focused on the scientific impact of a
   platform's programming community that produces these digital scientific
   innovations. The article's main theoretical argument is that beyond an
   individual's contribution efforts to these innovations, a new social
   structure affects his scientific recognition through citations of his
   tools in text-based publications. Taking a practice theory lens, we
   introduce the concept of a digital practice structure that emerges from
   the digital innovation work practice, performed by programmers who
   jointly work on a tool. This digital practice creates dependence forces
   among the community members in an analogy to Newton's gravity concept.
   Our model represents such dependencies in a spatial autocorrelative
   model. We empirically estimate this model using data of the programming
   community of nanoHUB in which 477 nanotechnology tool programmers have
   contributed more than 715 million lines of code. Our results show that a
   programmer's contributions to digital innovations may have positive
   effects, while the digital practice structure creates negative
   dependency effects. Colloquially speaking, being surrounded by star
   performers can be harmful. Our findings suggest that modeling scientific
   impact needs to account for a scientist's contribution to programming
   communities that produce digital scientific innovations and the digital
   work structures in which these contributions are embedded.

AB The financial industry has been strongly influenced by digitalization in
   the past few years reflected by the emergence of "FinTech," which
   represents the marriage of "finance" and "information technology."
   FinTech provides opportunities for the creation of new services and
   business models and poses challenges to traditional financial service
   providers. Therefore, FinTech has become a subject of debate among
   practitioners, investors, and researchers and is highly visible in the
   popular media. In this study, we unveil the drivers motivating the
   FinTech phenomenon perceived by the English and German popular press
   including the subjects discussed in the context of FinTech. This study
   is the first one to reflect the media perspective on the FinTech
   phenomenon in the research. In doing so, we extend the growing knowledge
   on FinTech and contribute to a common understanding in the financial and
   digital innovation literature. These study contributes to research in
   the areas of information systems, finance and interdisciplinary social
   sciences. Moreover, it brings value to practitioners (entrepreneurs,
   investors, regulators, etc.), who explore the field of FinTech.

AB Over the last 15 years, there has been great interest and commensurate
   momentum in the land administration industry on realising the notion of
   '3D cadastres'. This leverages 3D digital technologies for producing,
   managing, registering and communicating information about complex,
   volumetrically defined land and property rights, restrictions and
   responsibilities (RRRs) that are commonly found in cities and urban
   areas around the world. There has been significant technical progress
   but implementation remains uncertain. This paper draws on research
   conducted on the implementation of 3D Building Information Models (BIM)
   for regulatory processes in the land development industry in Singapore
   to illustrate the range of strategies used to induce change in an
   instance of 3D digital innovation. The adoption of institutional theory
   as an analytical framework provides insight into the cultural and
   behavioural underpinnings of these strategies and what makes them
   particularly effective in producing a positive response to change. Given
   the similarity in the institutional characteristics of the land
   development and land administration industries, the case study findings
   are used to develop a framework of strategic principles that could
   conceivably be used to support ongoing international efforts to realise
   3D cadastres. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A new multi-disciplinary degree program in education and information
   studies was developed to uniquely facilitate educators' capacity to be
   responsive to the demands of a digitally connected world. Charles Sturt
   University's Master of Education (Knowledge Networks and Digital
   Innovation) aims to develop agile leaders in new cultures of digital
   formal and informal learning. The co-construction of knowledge through
   interpersonal discourse creates a pedagogical tension between a focus on
   knowledge-based instruction and outcomes, and on praxis-based
   instruction. This digital context draws attention to academic integrity
   issues in online learning environments. Through the new subject
   Game-Based Learning, students engaged in theory, practice, trends in
   game designs and immersive aspects of game, utilizing the technology and
   pedagogical affordances of a range of online tools. The subject builds
   on the keystone subject and incorporates reflective participation and a
   culture of participatory learning through integration of social media,
   social scholarship and open sharing of ideas, resources and experiences
   online within the broader education community. Subject engagement and
   assessment design incorporated academic integrity strategies, and needed
   individual and group collaboration to be fully integrated into the
   learning experience of the students, thus modeling practices relevant to
   the student's own processional practices. This paper also considers the
   contribution of global connectedness to the success of the pedagogic
   processes used for embedding academic integrity through social
   scholarship into the curriculum and learning experiences.

AB Background: Emotional well-being is a primary component of mental health
   and well-being. Monitoring changes in emotional state daily over
   extended periods is, however, difficult using traditional methodologies.
   Providing mental health support is also challenging when approximately
   only 1 in 2 people with mental health issues seek professional help.
   Mobile phone technology offers a sustainable means of enhancing
   self-management of emotional well-being.
   Objective: This paper aims to describe the development of a mobile phone
   tool designed to monitor emotional changes in a natural everyday context
   and in real time.
   Methods: This evidence-informed mobile phone app monitors emotional
   mental health and well-being, and it provides links to mental health
   organization websites and resources. The app obtains data via
   self-report psychological questionnaires, experience sampling
   methodology (ESM), and automated behavioral data collection.
   Results: Feedback from 11 individuals (age range 16-52 years; 4 males, 7
   females), who tested the app over 30 days, confirmed via survey and
   focus group methods that the app was functional and usable.
   Conclusions: Recommendations for future researchers and developers of
   mental health apps to be used for research are also presented. The
   methodology described in this paper offers a powerful tool for a range
   of potential mental health research studies and provides a valuable
   standard against which development of future mental health apps should
   be considered.

AB Besides investing in infrastructures and personnel training, Transilien,
   SNCF subsidiary company in Ile-de-France, has focused in November 2013
   its open innovation initiative on the subject of accessibility. In the
   context of an innovation contest, developers, designers and disabled
   people meet to conceive digital services prototypes aiming at "improving
   accessibility for everyone". This way of dealing with accessibility is
   suprising regarding classical methods. In exemple, the law of february
   the 11th 2005 for equality of rights and chances, disabled people's
   participation and citizenship, compels public establishment to "suppress
   as many obstacles as possible to the moving and the us of the building".
   This paper focuses on the representations of accessibility embodied in
   the prototypes conceived by Transilien digital innovation contest's
   participant. These representations are compared with classical one's,
   and which highlights many shifts linked to innovator's work. Whereas the
   law of 2005 insists on the social responsibility of developing
   accessible public establishments, the digital approach of accessibility
   associates disabled people autonomy with sotfware applications
   development, assuming smartphone-mediated social interactions and
   fostering collective effort towards the development of an informational
   infrastructure.

AB Internet of things (IoT) is showing promise of digital innovation. It is
   becoming cheaper and easier to collect data from mechanical, electrical
   and control systems. It has become practical to perform asset
   instrumentation, predictive maintenance and condition-based maintenance.
   Data center technologies include generators, uninterruptible power
   supplies, HVAC systems, liquid chiller loops, and all the power delivery
   circuits required for the data center. We have ability to measure
   parameters on a customer-by-customer basis. Creating an IoT platform to
   collect, store, analyze and deliver actionable intelligence to the right
   person real-time for predictive maintenance or resolve issues delivers
   increased customer service level agreements.

AB Today, companies often face rapid and substantial change of their
   business environment. To stay competitive, firms are forced to engage in
   continuous innovation of their products and services. Moreover, the
   digitization of society and organizations has led to an increase in
   radical and disruptive innovations across all industries and trades. As
   a result, companies often find it difficult to develop an organizational
   identity - a shared understanding of "who are we" and "what makes us
   different from others". In this article, we combine extant theory on
   both digital innovation and identity formation processes to develop a
   conceptual model of identity formation, highlighting the dynamics
   between innovation and identity formation. We use our model to discuss
   symptoms that organizations might experience when engaging in digital
   innovation, shaping the process of identity development. Finally, we
   suggest future research topics to investigate the relationship between
   innovation and identity formation processes.

AB The world is full of signs (symbols, signifiers, words included). They
   guide us in supermarkets, on highways and in airports. They even guide
   us to the right bathroom. Signs also help us when we read manuals or
   when we use a remote control. They are taken for reasoning important
   decisions in the medical as well as in the financial and business world.
   Signs are used everywhere. A less understood characteristic of signs is
   that they render service in very different ways. This chapter analyses
   how signs render service when "carrying'' meaning, when they imply
   actions and when they change thinking. The findings reveal how signs
   affect services which are important to support future research on signs

AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to provide more insight in the
   ways key users act as knowledge managers and boundary spanners during
   the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system usage phase. Despite the
   recognized importance of key users during the implementation phase of an
   ERP system, little is known about their role in the ERP usage phase.
   Design/methodology/approach - To provide rich insight in the
   boundary-spanning mechanisms utilized by key users to share knowledge, a
   qualitative approach was applied. In this study, "abductive" theme
   coding for 58 interviews with key users, end-users and managers has been
   used. This paper found six mechanisms and characterized them as
   "crossing" structural, social or cognitive boundaries.
   Findings - Six boundary-spanning mechanisms have been distinguished
   which have been applied by key users to overcome several knowledge
   management issues. Subsequently, these mechanisms lead to a model which
   describes three different roles that key users may fulfill to
   efficiently share and transfer knowledge during the ERP usage phase.
   Research limitations/implications - Knowledge barriers during an ERP
   implementation and their accompanying six boundary-crossing mechanisms
   have been distinguished.
   Practical implications - The recognition of the essential role that key
   users can fulfill during the usage phase of an ERP system is an
   important implication. Management has to take into account that tasks
   and responsibilities of key users have to be clear from the start and
   they may cautiously select employees who are suited to become key users.
   Originality/value - The main contribution is the importance of the
   impact of key users on the effectivity of knowledge management during
   the ERP usage phase.

AB This article puts forward the notion of animistic design as an
   uncertainty-driven strategy to reimagine human-machine interaction as a
   milieu of human and nonhuman. Animistic design is suggested as capable
   of fostering affects, sensibilities and thoughts that capitalize on the
   uncertain, the unpredictable and the nonlinear, and their capacity to
   trigger creative pathways. Informed by post-human philosophies, theories
   of mediation and materiality, as well as by affect, agency and
   aesthesia, animistic design eschews the anthropomorphic and the cute
   playfulness often associated with animism. Instead, it proposes a
   practical-theoretical framework to articulate the nexus of digital
   innovation, interaction design practices, technical materialities and
   affective responses already emerging in the digital cohabitation of the
   human and the nonhuman. Using a research through making' approach, the
   article describes in detail a series of animistic design experiments and
   prototyping methods that explore ways of rethinking interaction as an
   open-ended and creative enterprise. Animistic design offers an
   investigative strategy that exploits degrees of collaboratively curated
   uncertainty and unpredictability to imagine forms of digital
   interaction, and to engender creative human-nonhuman relationships
   within a given digital milieu.

AB Global retailers are expanding their business to countries with diverse
   cultures and consumer preferences. Competitive and sustainable retail
   chains require advanced e-services linked to in-store digital
   innovations. This research focuses on cultural dimensions and the
   implications of implementing global and internet-linked e-service
   innovations. The research studies how cultural dimensions influence
   consumers' attitudes toward five types of retail innovations. The
   cultural dimensions include uncertainty avoidance and collectivistic
   cultural dimensions to predict acceptance. The research case compares
   differences between Taiwanese and Swedish university students. A
   multi-attribute model shows that Taiwanese prefer innovations with a
   lower level of self-service. On the other hand, Swedish prefer opposite
   types of retail innovations. We propose future research to show that
   these barriers of acceptance can be lowered through the use of
   advertising, social media, and in-store interaction between customers
   and staff. The research yields new research directions to help
   international retailers develop competitive strategies to fit the
   cultural characteristics of consumers.

AB In an era of increased human pressure on planet Earth, sound
   environmental governance regimes are more important than ever. Digital
   technologies are increasingly turned to by environmental regulators to
   aid governance and communication. We examine the 'behind the scenes'
   institutional dynamics of a public body in its digital information
   provision (specifically dynamic river level information). Based on
   in-depth interviews with staff across a large environmental regulator we
   have brought to light four pivotal areas of institutional dynamics: (1)
   institutional priority and path dependency; (2) management and
   resources; (3) institutional identity and interdepartmental dynamics;
   and (4) ability and willingness to change. We gained insight into
   explicit and covert barriers and opportunities in relation to digital
   information provision that are likely to occur in other public
   institutions too. Besides identified barriers that were of a technical,
   structural, managerial or cultural nature, arguably the most important
   barrier was conceptual, i.e. the prevalence of 'efficiency and efficacy'
   perspectives on information and communications technology (ICT) amongst
   staff, in which ICT is primarily perceived as a neutral solution in
   itself to a wide variety of issues. Opportunities were nonetheless
   present in the form of enthusiasm and some critical thinking about
   digital innovation among staff, and an emphasis on the importance of
   stakeholder inclusion in the design of ICT. We conclude that there is a
   need to connect institutional social learning with the development of
   'conceptual perspectives' on ICT, in which ICT is not seen as a solution
   in itself, but as a set of tools in a wider transformational process, or
   as a lens to look at existing or new practices. This is more likely to
   strengthen cornerstones of contemporary environmental governance, such
   as improved information access and reconceptualisations of 'traditional'
   barriers of uncertainty, liability and distrust in relation to
   information provision. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper outlines a series of key developments and interventions that
   have enabled a platform for digital innovation in the management and
   administration of the assessment and feedback processes within a top 10
   UK University.
   The joined up platform of technological solutions and associated
   transformative staff practices demonstrated a wide impact on efficiency
   and productivity across the organisation. The initiative adopted new
   approaches to innovation and change to help deal with two major
   challenges:
   1 Addressing the technical, organisational and cultural complexity of
   such a programme of work.
   2 Addressing the challenge of limited resources with which to deliver
   lean, practical and useful digital solutions that can be efficiently and
   effectively adopted by staff and scaled up across the institution.
   OUR CHALLENGE -Members of staff use a disparate set of learning
   technologies and desktop software to create and deliver assessments and
   to mark work and provide feedback to students. Each department and
   School tended to operate using a different set of procedures and forms
   to issue assessments and collect submissions, register participation and
   provide feedback. There was no clear and consistent mechanism to return
   work back to students or to check the consistency and quality of
   feedback. Individual practices and attitudes varied and academic staff
   needed to be convinced that new ways of working would be better for
   themselves and their students, especially with regards to adopting and
   accepting new technologies.
   OUR APPROACH - This paper describes the pragmatic and agile way in which
   a small team set out to try and improve things one step at a time with
   the limited resources that were available to them. This initiative was a
   community driven activity taking an agile and very lean approach to
   change. It was recognised that changes to pedagogic and administrative
   practices, as well as development of a variety of digital solutions
   would be required.
   THE SOLUTION - The digital platform developed (containing 5 components)
   comprises; features for assessment planning; communication; collecting
   data on submissions; collating data on feedback and returns; using the
   data to provide actionable insights in student engagement and staff
   practices; support a feedback dialogue between multiple staff and
   students; create a digital platform architecture underpinning multiple
   assessments, submissions and feedback types and applications; the
   creation of an assessment and submission data standard in order to join
   up data in disparate systems.
   DIGITAL INNOVATION - All staff embraced new social and technical
   methodologies to address pedagogic practices and technical hurdles.
   2014/15 marked a significant year in the process of development and
   adoption. The CASPA application became a mature, useful and highly used
   product. The roll-out of stand-alone kiosks and integration of
   assessment and submission data into the tutoring system Co-Tutor, was so
   successful, that adoption went from 4 departments to 9 in one year with
   minimal need for advocacy or support. Systems integration work via a
   data warehouse, creating a taxonomy for assessments, submissions and
   feedback data, is innovative in the sector allowing multiple learning
   technologies to 'talk to each other' effectively.
   This paper will be of interest to practitioners and IT staff who are
   involved in the development, implementation and embedding of systems and
   process in their own universities.

AB Platforms have evolved beyond just being organized as multi-sided
   markets with complementors selling to users. Complementors are often
   unpaid, working outside of a price system and driven by heterogeneous
   sources of motivationwhich should affect how they respond to platform
   growth. Does reliance on network effects and strategies to attract large
   numbers of complementors remain advisable in such contexts? We test
   hypotheses related to these issues using data from 85 online
   multi-player game platforms with unpaid complementors. We find that
   complementor development responds to platform growth even without sales
   incentives, but that attracting complementors has a net zero effect on
   on-going development and fails to stimulate network effects. We discuss
   conditions under which a strategy of using unpaid crowd complementors
   remains advantageous. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Digital technology is changing nature conservation in increasingly
   profound ways. We describe this impact and its significance through the
   concept of 'digital conservation', which we found to comprise five
   pivotal dimensions: data on nature, data on people, data integration and
   analysis, communication and experience, and participatory governance.
   Examining digital innovation in nature conservation and addressing how
   its development, implementation and diffusion may be steered, we warn
   against hypes, techno-fix thinking, good news narratives and unverified
   assumptions. We identify a need for rigorous evaluation, more
   comprehensive consideration of social exclusion, frameworks for
   regulation and increased multi-sector as well as multi-discipline
   awareness and cooperation. Along the way, digital technology may best be
   reconceptualised by conservationists from something that is either good
   or bad, to a dual-faced force in need of guidance.

AB Nature conservation organisations increasingly turn to new digital
   technologies to help deliver conservation objectives. This has led to
   collaborative forms of working with academia to spearhead digital
   innovation. Through in-depth interviews with three UK
   research-council-funded case studies, we show that by working with
   academics conservation organisations can receive positive and negative
   impacts, some of which cut across their operations. Positive impacts
   include new ways of engaging with audiences, improved data workflows,
   financial benefits, capacity building and the necessary digital
   infrastructure to help them influence policy. Negative impacts include
   the time and resources required to learn new skills and sustain new
   technologies, managing different organisational objectives and shifts in
   working practices as a result of the new technologies. Most importantly,
   collaboration with academics was shown to bring the opportunity of a
   profound change in perspectives on technologies with benefits to the
   partner organisations and individuals therein.

AB The application of digital technology in conservation holds much
   potential for advancing the understanding of, and facilitating
   interaction with, the natural world. In other sectors, digital
   technology has long been used to engage communities and share
   information. Human development-which holds parallels with the nature
   conservation sector-has seen a proliferation of innovation in
   technological development. Throughout this Perspective, we consider what
   nature conservation can learn from the introduction of digital
   technology in human development. From this, we derive a charter to be
   used before and throughout project development, in order to help reduce
   replication and failure of digital innovation in nature conservation
   projects. We argue that the proposed charter will promote collaboration
   with the development of digital tools and ensure that nature
   conservation projects progress appropriately with the development of new
   digital technologies.

AB The availability of affordable 'recreational' camera traps has
   dramatically increased over the last decade. We present survey results
   which show that many conservation practitioners use cheaper
   'recreational' units for research rather than more expensive
   'professional' equipment. We present our perspective of using two
   popular models of 'recreational' camera trap for ecological field-based
   studies. The models used (for > 2 years) presented us with a range of
   practical problems at all stages of their use including deployment,
   operation, and data management, which collectively crippled data
   collection and limited opportunities for quantification of key issues
   arising. Our experiences demonstrate that prospective users need to have
   a sufficient understanding of the limitations camera trap technology
   poses, dimensions we communicate here. While the merits of different
   camera traps will be study specific, the performance of more expensive
   'professional' models may prove more cost-effective in the long-term
   when using camera traps for research.

AB The Information Systems (IS) field has never been more relevant as
   digital innovations are emerging at a rapid pace fuelled by recombinant
   innovations based on digital infrastructures, advanced middle-ware
   layers, and mobile and ubiquitous technologies. This paper argues, based
   on a bibliometric study of the representation of a mobile ICT discourse
   within the AIS Senior Scholars' 'basket' of eight IS journals over the
   past 15 years, that the field needs to become much more academically
   agile. The study showed that a mere 3.2% of all papers published during
   this period had any relationship to one of the key technological
   phenomena in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The paper
   formulates the hypothesis that the relative shift in impact between
   European- and US-based journals within the 'basket of 8' could have been
   influenced by editorial strategising to further encourage academic
   agility exploring new horizons rather than emphasis on further
   exploitation of existing ground. The paper, further argues that the IS
   field seems to more readily engage in a debate of phenomena involving
   centralised and organisationally-bound technological innovations whereas
   distributed, decentralised and infrastructural discourses find it much
   more difficult to gain a foothold. So, whilst the IS field may still be
   stuck in the mainframe age, it needs to move beyond in order to fully
   engage with the world we live in. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Purpose: In the past channel literature has looked to other disciplines
   in developing and refining their theories, models and methods in order
   to evolve the field. This paper traces such history and highlights the
   substantial changes caused by the digital age. In light of this, the
   inclusion of design theory into future channel management is presented
   to overcome existing concerns.
   Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive review of literature on the
   history of channels, the emotional experience (people), limitations of
   digital innovation (technology) and the role of design (business) has
   been conducted to create a new approach, built upon the theory of the
   techno-economic innovation model.
   Findings: The findings of this study propose design-led channel
   management as a new research area, providing novel research questions
   and future research directions. The inclusion of design and emotion
   theories indicates that the future of digital channel design requires a
   deeper understanding of customers and needs to go beyond technological
   advances.
   Theoretical implications: The findings provide an opportunity to explore
   dynamic theories and methodologies within the field of design that will
   broaden the horizons and challenge existing notions in channel
   literature.
   Originality/value: This paper is the first paper that introduces the
   theory of Ernotionate, as the next evolution of channel literature. The
   value of Emotionate lies in providing a new design led process of
   integrating emotion to provide advice to practitioners as well as
   identifies research areas for academia, thereby extending the reach and
   richness of this emerging research field. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The UK government is mandating the use of building information modelling
   (BIM) in large public projects by 2016. As a result, engineering firms
   are faced with challenges related to embedding new technologies and
   associated working practices for the digital delivery of major
   infrastructure projects. Diffusion of innovations theory is used to
   investigate how digital innovations diffuse across complex firms. A
   contextualist approach is employed through an in-depth case study of a
   large, international engineering project-based firm. The analysis of the
   empirical data, which was collected over a four-year period of close
   interaction with the firm, reveals parallel paths of diffusion occurring
   across the firm, where both the innovation and the firm context were
   continually changing. The diffusion process is traced over three phases:
   centralization of technology management, standardization of digital
   working practices, and globalization of digital resources. The findings
   describe the diffusion of a digital innovation as multiple and partial
   within a complex social system during times of change and organizational
   uncertainty, thereby contributing to diffusion of innovations studies in
   construction by showing a range of activities and dynamics of a
   non-linear diffusion process.

AB Digital technologies have fundamentally altered the nature of organizing

   analyzing, disseminating, or leveraging the data for many applications,
   from enterprise computing to mobile, consumer oriented applications.
   'Big data' is an increasingly important 'engine' to better understand
   the complex 'nervous system' of open collaboration. However, we need to
   equip open collaboration researchers with new datasets that span
   different contexts, as well as novel computational models and analytical
   techniques. In this paper, we will elaborate on research questions
   concerning open digital collaboration and derive the data analytical
   challenges that need to be addressed to answer these research questions.

AB In this article, we offer a broadened view of service innovation-one
   grounded in service-dominant logic-that transcends the
   tangible-intangible and producer-consumer divides that have plagued
   extant research in this area. Such a broadened conceptualization of
   service innovation emphasizes (1) innovation as a collaborative process
   occurring in an actor-to-actor (A2A) network, (2) service as the
   application of specialized competences for the benefit of another actor
   or the self and as the basis of all exchange, (3) the generativity
   unleashed by increasing resource liquefaction and resource density, and
   (4) resource integration as the fundamental way to innovate. Building on
   these core themes, we offer a tripartite framework of service
   innovation: (1) service ecosystems, as emergent A2A structures actors
   create and recreate through their effectual actions and which offer an
   organizing logic for the actors to exchange service and cocreate value;
   (2) service platforms, which enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of
   service exchange by liquefying resources and increasing resource density
   (facilitating easy access to appropriate resource bundles) and thereby
   serve as the venue for innovation; and (3) value cocreation, which views
   value as cocreated by the service offer(er) and the service beneficiary
   (e. g., customer) through resource integration and indicate the need for
   mechanisms to support the underlying roles and processes. In discussing
   these components, we consider the role of information technology-both as
   an operand resource and as an operant resource-and then examine the
   implications for research and practice in digitally enabled service
   innovation.

AB Nowadays we cannot speak of a society without linking it to instant,
   global and, digital knowledge. Since 2001, Information Society
   Technology (IST) associated with a new type of citizens -the digital
   natives- provoked severe changes to which not only countries, regions,
   and society, but also individuals, are trying to adapt in a race still
   not finished. Policies focus on smart growth through the development of
   knowledge and innovation as a starting point to accomplish the process.
   The process of adaptation of any digital innovation to local and global
   challenges makes from resilience a must in a global society.
   The success of a resilience society comes from the hand of those
   individuals that form the society. If we live in a digital society
   growing in digital possibilities as the technology continues improving,
   those individuals will be evolved digital natives fully experienced and
   updated because they have grown up in a discovery-driven learning
   environment. For a resilient society it is crucial to get to know how
   its new individuals arc learning new habits, abilities and capabilities
   and how they are using them, so that it will be feasible to help them to
   solve problems still not known with solutions not even imagined.
   The present work tries to define the new digital citizen that will be
   fully able to adapt himself to new challenges and quickly recover from
   old ones.

AB Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, faces critical transportation challenges
   today. Traffic-related congestion, high road fatality rates and an
   unregulated mass transit network have been issues for long in East
   Africa's most populous city. Barriers to mobility have increased with
   rapid urbanization, resulting in a highly inefficient and inequitable
   transport system. Despite the government's commitment to improve
   infrastructure, urban planning and regulation, progress has been slow.
   Corporate players too have introduced well-funded initiatives, but met
   with little success. On the other hand, the innovation ecosystem has
   produced several mobility services that show potential to alleviate pain
   points in urban transportation. In June-Aug 2014, we interviewed 65 key
   informants and completed 16 observations to understand the role of
   startup innovation in improving Nairobi's transport system. We came
   across 30 startups engaged in the transport and logistics space. Their
   innovations were all internet or mobile phone-based. Startups played a
   unique role vis-a-vis government and corporates by plugging information
   gaps inexpensively. The value of information they generated had varying
   degrees of impact, as discussed in the 'impact pyramid'. To develop
   high-impact innovations, startups had to overcome a large 'trust
   deficit' among Kenyans. Furthermore, startups faced serious supply-side
   challenges due to financial, operational, regulatory, technical and
   environmental factors. In summary, this paper shows that startups played
   a crucial role in improving Nairobi's transportation. However, they are
   limited by the symptomatic relief their solutions provide. To enable
   startups to create sustainable impact, recommendations are made to state
   and non-profit actors.

AB Technological and digital innovations have invaded our daily life and
   affected our lifestyle. Innovations in digital technology are used to
   improve the learning process and the management of the school. The
   secondary schools in Ilia, Greece, are given the opportunity to profit
   innovative services of digital technology.
   The aim of the paper is to examine whether the secondary schools
   (teachers and educational leaders) of Ilia are ready to face the
   challenge of technological and digital innovation. This paper offers
   some thoughts on the attitude of the educational leaders to new
   technology, teachers' training to meet the demands of technological and
   digital development that happens, the way that these innovations are
   used and the structures that exist in secondary schools to implement ICT
   innovation.
   The topics which will be discussed are the technological and digital
   innovation in educational environment, the role of educational leaders
   to change and to technological and digital evolution contributing to the
   quality of learning and the welfare of students. The topics covered have
   been objects of extensive researches so there is a lot of bibliography
   published on the subject.
   The tool used for conducting the survey is the questionnaires handed out
   to teachers concerning the improvement of the educational process with
   the use of technology.
   This tool is valid for drawing examples which illustrate the research
   effectively.
   The survey is used to power a critical perspective on technological and
   digital innovations contemplating the strengths and weaknesses of the
   application of technological and digital innovations in teaching in
   secondary schools of Ilia. In conclusion, it will highlight the
   relationship between the technological and digital innovation and
   improvement of teaching-learning.

AB In a short period of time, medias have talked about MOOCs with high
   expectations, followed by great disappointments. Such a reversal of the
   trend is typical of technological determinism, which is a prominent
   approach of educational technologies. Against this background, the
   objective of this paper is to analyze general media discourses about
   MOOCs in a critical perspective. We used a content analysis method to
   characterize discourses of press articles and to assess the extent to
   which they convey a technological determinist view. We finally draw some
   concluding remarks about the way education technologies are socially
   perceived.

AB The present research paper is focusing on the way social innovation is
   shaping the digital civil society. As new as it is, this concept has
   roots in local and international initiative, coming both from citizens
   and from organizations, with the purpose to use private resources for
   the public good. The primary aim is to make an exploratory intercession
   in the way we can define digital civil society, to identify the patterns
   in the social innovation as a global shaper for it and to map a start
   line for future analytical research, analyzing a series of online
   platforms and applications across the globe. In order to map the current
   state of the concept of digital civil society and to identify the most
   important aspects of it, the authors have chosen to develop their
   methodology research based on international insights provided by
   nonprofit organizations whose mission is to offer access to technology
   and to use technology for the community development and from
   international examples of digital innovation for the social good. This
   emergent research gave the authors a better understanding of the
   international context and mapping initiatives that have passed the
   incipient stage and are become a norm.

AB The purpose of this ongoing, three-year action research study is to
   explore the digital challenges of student engagement in higher education
   within the experimental platform of blended learning. Research questions
   examine the role of digital innovation in supporting diverse learners,
   as well as building meaningful connections with technology for
   undergraduate teacher education students. Results from qualitative data
   collected through instructor journals and field notes and student
   mid-term and exit surveys during year one, indicate blended learning can
   be effective for modelling how to use technology to shift learners
   towards more active agency. The immediacy of the localised university
   classroom delivered a viable research setting for digital
   experimentation, while providing a significant lived experience for
   undergraduates to springboard their future technological practices with
   K-12 students. Four pedagogical opportunities for digital intentionality
   in virtual spaces emerged during data analysis and are shared as
   considerations for future innovation: (1) designing digital resources,
   (2) scaffolding student learning, (3) learner customisation, and (4)
   promoting the lived experience. Lessons learned could be effective in
   helping develop higher quality educational experiences for on-campus
   students, as well as scaffolding greater engagement in online formats
   involving more global populations (e.g., massive online open courses
   MOOCs).

AB Although extant research convincingly argues that managers can change
   product innovation practices by exploiting new forms of generativity
   afforded by digital technology, the literature has so far been silent on
   how incumbent firms may conceive of and implement requisite generative
   capability. Against this backdrop, we report from an action research
   study into a digital innovation initiative aimed at developing connected
   cars. The managers in charge of the initiative engaged us as they faced
   considerable skepticism and push-back from the organization. To help the
   firm embrace new innovation norms and practices, we therefore infused
   innovation theory and options thinking into the group of managers as a
   means to conceive of and implement generative capability. As a result,
   we present and validate an integrative theoretical model of how
   incumbent firms may leverage digital options thinking to shape their
   organizational and technological resources into requisite generative
   capability. In conclusion, we discuss the contributions of the model and
   the empirical results to extant literature on generative capability in
   digital innovation.

AB With the advent of a third wave of digitization designers are facing new
   challenges to create products and services. We believe that the
   far-reaching user involvement and the flexible functionalities of
   third-wave digital innovation is radically changing the work field of
   designers.
   The paper focuses on two main effects of third-wave digital innovation;
   convergence and generativity. We analyzed the consequence of these two
   effects on three process-oriented roles of the designer that make up an
   important part of Design Thinking: (1) the designer as integrator; (2)
   the designer as boundary creator; and (3) the designer as the user's
   advocate.
   Based on this analysis, we propose three new roles that better fit the
   third wave of digital innovation: (1) designers as function
   orchestrators; (2) designers as gatekeepers of initiatives; and (3)
   designers as advocates of human desire. To fulfill these new roles and
   to equip designers for the new wave of digital innovation, we belief
   that there is a need for reconceptualizing Design Thinking.

AB Digital technology is increasingly important in achieving business
   goals, and its pervasive effects have resulted in the radical
   restructuring of entire industries. Consequently, managers' extensive
   interest in handling digital innovation is not surprising. Recent
   research has illustrated how digital technologies give rise to a vast
   potential for product and service innovation that is difficult to
   control and predict. Therefore, firms need dynamic tools to support
   themselves in managing the new types of digital innovation processes
   that emerge. The nature of these processes forces firms to challenge
   prior assumptions about their product and service portfolio, their
   digital environment, and ways of organizing innovation work. In this
   article, we present a managerial framework that supports firms in this
   undertaking. The framework, geared at supporting ongoing improvements in
   digital innovation management, covers five key areas: user experience,
   value proposition, digital evolution scanning, skills, and
   improvisation. We also present a diagnostic tool that can be utilized as
   firms begin the process of implementing the framework. Finally, we
   conclude with our thoughts on the managerial implications of the
   framework when going forward in a rapidly changing digital innovation
   landscape. (C) 2014 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

AB Curriculum development is a complex, iterative process with a great
   number of sub processes and activities. Managing curriculum redesign
   requires continuous review and adjustment of its numerous features with
   regional and national interests, universities' strategic documents,
   requirements set by national and international accreditation standards,
   as well as with different needs of many external and internal
   stakeholders. Business Informatics curriculum redesign process had been
   carried out more frequently over the past decade, primarily due to
   persistent major changes in information technology and expansion of its
   application in business. Contemporary innovative aspects of this process
   intensely contribute to the need for curriculum redesign. Among the most
   important ones that necessitate detailed analysis and purposeful
   modification of key competencies, as well as the content of core and
   elective courses of curricula, are digital product, process and business
   model innovations, along with the interdisciplinary approach to
   development.
   This paper proposes a modified curriculum development process based on
   ADDIE model, specifically intended to recognize the roles of different
   stakeholders and utilize their input for curriculum redesign. ADDIE
   model is a general purpose development model, generic, systematic,
   step-by-step framework for iterative design, structured into four
   phases: Analysis, Design, Development and Implementation.
   The modified curriculum redesign process presented in this paper
   implements the initial activity of identifying key curriculum
   stakeholders, followed by identification of their requirements,
   identification of curriculum key competences, curriculum evaluation and
   quality assessment. Application of the redesigned and innovated process
   based on ADDIE model, with recognition of influence that digital
   innovation and interdisciplinarity, resulted in development of a
   business informatics curriculum. In addition to aforementioned
   activities, the model encompasses content analysis of curricula in the
   same field developed and implemented at different universities
   worldwide. It also incorporates many years of authors' experience gained
   thru previously developed and implemented curricula at the Faculty of
   Economics in Subotica. Details of core and elective courses, as well as
   specific ways of their implementation, are particularly highlighted in
   the paper.

AB Emerging from the rapid growth of information technology (IT) in a
   digital world is the explosion and rapid ascent of IT-related service
   innovation occurring around the globe. All successful service innovation
   in a digital world consists of two main abstract domains: signs (because
   only signs can be digitized) and practices. Signs are perceivable, but
   practices are not. Signs are commonly understood as resources in the
   digital world, whereas practices are understood as providing context,
   not as resources. This article proposes a change in this perspective:
   according to service-dominant logic, both signs and practices can become
   resources for service and value cocreation. They become resources if
   they are integrated in a service offering. We illustrate how recent
   digital service innovations can be explained with this perspective and
   how it can be used to distinguish incremental from radical innovation.
   The article also suggests, using this perspective, that IT and
   innovation specialists can productively develop ideas and concepts for
   future service innovation. From the practices framework presented,
   directions for further research are discussed.

AB With the aim of integrating HIV and tuberculosis care in rural Kenya, a
   team of researchers, clinicians, and technologists used the
   human-centered design approach to facilitate design, development, and
   deployment processes of new patient-specific TB clinical decision
   support system for medical providers. In Kenya, approximately 1.6
   million people are living with HIV and have a 20-times higher risk of
   dying of tuberculosis. Although tuberculosis prevention and treatment
   medication is widely available, proven to save lives, and prioritized by
   the World Health Organization, ensuring that it reaches the most
   vulnerable communities remains challenging. Human-centered design, used
   in the fields of industrial design and information technology for
   decades, is an approach to improving the effectiveness and impact of
   innovations that has been scarcely used in the health field. Using this
   approach, our team followed a 3-step process, involving mixed methods
   assessment to (1) understand the situation through the collection and
   analysis of site observation sessions and key informant interviews; (2)
   develop a new clinical decision support system through iterative
   prototyping, end-user engagement, and usability testing; and, (3)
   implement and evaluate the system across 24 clinics in rural West Kenya.
   Through the application of this approach, we found that human-centered
   design facilitated the process of digital innovation in a complex and
   resource-constrained context.

AB The 50-year march of Moore's Law has led to the creation of a relatively
   cheap and increasingly easy-to-use world-wide digital infrastructure of
   computers, mobile devices, broadband network connections, and advanced
   application platforms. This digital infrastructure has, in turn,
   accelerated the emergence of new technologies that enable
   transformations in how we live and work, how companies organize, and the
   structure of entire industries.
   As a result, it has become important for all business students to have a
   strong grounding in IT and digital innovation in order to manage, lead,
   and transform organizations that are increasingly dependent on digital
   innovation. Yet, at many schools, students do not get such grounding
   because the required information systems core class is stuck in the
   past. We present a vision for a redesigned IS core class that adopts
   digital innovation as a fundamental and powerful concept (FPC). A good
   FPC serves as both a foundational concept and an organizing principle
   for a course.
   We espouse a particularly broad conceptualization of digital innovation
   that allows for a variety of teaching styles and topical emphases for
   the IS core class. This conceptualization includes three types of
   innovation (i.e., process, product, and business model innovation), and
   four stages for the overall innovation process (i.e., discovery,
   development, diffusion, and impact). Based on this conceptualization, we
   examine the implications of adopting digital innovation as an FPC. We
   also briefly discuss broader implications relating to (1) the IS
   curriculum beyond the core class, (2) the research agenda for the IS
   field, and (3) the identity and legitimacy of IS in business schools.

   University of Novi Sad. The mentioned subject deals with media reporting
   and journalist engagement on the place where catastrophes caused by
   people (terrorism, explosions, car accidents, citizen gatherings, fires)
   or natural calamities (floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes,
   tornadoes, extremely bad weather conditions) happen. The subject
   syllabus for a school year is carried out during one term with two
   classes of lecture and two classes of exercise per week. Students are
   interested in carrying through the syllabus and a number of those
   enrolled in this elective reaches maximum which is about 35 students for
   each course. We carried out a study on a theme of possibility of using a
   media digital technology in performing the syllabus "Reporting in
   natural and intentionally caused catastrophes and disasters" with the
   aim to examine how much students are interested to make a use of new
   digital technologies in the teaching course. An extensive analysis of
   the students answers was made relating to their perception of the use of
   new digital technologies, lecturing on Skype, the importance of online
   debate with the aim of exchanging different views with the students from
   other universities in the region and world. The researchers were
   interested in how much students use digital resources when they write
   their term papers, if they have a good on line communication with their
   professors and assistant professors, if they would like to have an on
   line cooperation with the Military, the Fire Department or some other
   institutions which deal with crisis situations and which digital
   innovation they would implement into the realization of this subject
   syllabus. The fundamental idea in this project is to analyze the
   students attitudes about using of media digital technologies in the
   realization of this syllabus which offers great opportunities for
   implementing the mentioned technologies. We expect that the result of
   this research will be the modification of the plan and the syllabus for
   this subject, which is to implement innovations in the sense of
   application of digital technologies observed as the most significant by
   students. Thus the teaching course will be enriched and innovated with
   new digital technologies and the syllabus will be adapted to students
   requests.

AB In recent years, new digital technologies have significantly changed the
   way we live and work, as well as the way organizations operate. These
   new technologies caused the need for a serious approach to modification
   of higher education processes in the areas of business, especially
   business informatics. If they are to effectively direct strategies of
   modern organizations in the changed environment, managers, as key
   products of education in these areas, first and foremost must understand
   the occurring transformations (what is driving them, where they are
   headed). In addition to that, managers themselves need to become digital
   innovators, actively involved in these changes. Relatively inexpensive,
   easy-to-use digital infrastructure consisting of computers, mobile
   devices, broadband network connections, application platforms, etc.
   creates an opportunity for all business professionals to be a part of
   the innovation process and contribute to the success of their
   organizations.
   Digital innovations that are embodied in or enabled by information
   technologies (IT) are very broadly defined and include products,
   processes and business models. Such innovations require an analytical
   approach to both core and elective courses of business informatics
   curricula, as well as to and their purposeful modification.
   This paper briefly presents the characteristics of digital innovation as
   the basis for changes of curricula in the field of business informatics.
   Content of courses made necessary by digital innovations are
   particularly highlighted. A detailed analysis of competences and course
   contents was carried out based on a selection of existing curricula in
   this area that are implemented within several highest ranked
   universities in Europe. Lastly, this paper presents a preliminary
   proposal of an up-to-date business informatics curriculum which is in
   line with trends initiated by digital innovation.

AB Information Systems (IS) education deals with increasingly abstract and
   complex design challenges. Through digital innovation, the field
   continuously expands to new application areas. To develop design
   competence, students need to build up a repertoire of experiences
   enabling in-depth understanding of use context and design settings. Most
   students are young and have limited workplace experience. These
   circumstances are challenging to IS education and teaching. In this
   paper we share experiences from teaching and designing IS education to
   be adapted to this situation. We propose three teaching strategies for
   bringing authenticity and contextual relevance to IS education; (1)
   teaching by doing together, (2) enable authentic experiences, and (3)
   critical formative dialogue.

AB Purpose: Current guidelines for traumatic brain injury (TBI) recommend
   antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for 7 days after injury to decrease
   posttraumatic seizure risk. Phenytoin decreases seizure risk 73% vs
   placebo during this time. Levetiracetam (LEV) is an alternative;
   however, no published data validate comparable efficacy. Our objective
   was to evaluate seizure incidence 7 days after TBI in patients treated
   with phenytoin (PHT) vs LEV and to characterize practice of AED
   selection.
   Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted using a
   Trauma Registry (Collector Trauma Registry; Digital Innovation, Inc,
   Forrest Hill, Md) to evaluate patients with TBI. Patients with an
   initial Head/Neck Abbreviated Injury Scale score of 3 or higher and a
   Glasgow Coma Scale of 8 or less were included.
   Results: Of 109 patients, 89 received PHT, and 20, LEV. Two patients
   experienced posttraumatic seizure, 1 in each group. Sixty-eight patients
   survived to hospital discharge; 65% received prophylactic AED greater
   than 7 days. Ninety-eight percent of 81 patients admitted between 2000
   and 2007 received PHT, whereas 64% of 28 patients admitted between 2008
   and 2010 received LEV.
   Conclusion: Only 2 patients experienced posttraumatic seizure after
   receiving AED, indicating low incidence. Most surviving to hospital
   discharge received AED prophylaxis greater than 7 days despite guideline
   recommendations. After approval of intravenous LEV, a trend favoring LEV
   was observed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Digitization has greatly influenced the functioning of the television
   industry. This paper analyzes in particular how French television
   channels have innovated and adapted to digital technologies. We begin
   with a typology of innovation in the media by drawing a distinction
   between product innovations and process innovations, as well as between
   companies according to whether they were the first to adopt an
   innovation, or only adopted it once it was already well established in
   the field. A total of 21 criteria for innovation are analyzed for each
   of the 15 TV channels in our sample. This paper shows that TV channels
   have varied innovation strategies. Rather than some channels being
   innovators on all criteria and others being followers on all criteria,
   we show that channels adopt, more or less rapidly, certain types of
   innovation according to the channels’ characteristics. The
   characteristics that play the greatest role are the age of the channel,
   whether it is public or private, and whether it is general or thematic.

AB This article explores the development and implementation of a
   Toronto-based incubator supporting local women in developing their own
   games. The incubator was created to help change the current
   (male-dominated) status quo of game production, promising participants
   skills sharing, support for the development of a new game, and entry
   into the local community of indie games developers. It was at the same
   time part of a large network of commercial and non-commercial interests
   with a shared agenda of promoting the local digital innovation scene.
   These different motivations and actors are considered to understand the
   nature of this complex social network market and the circulation of
   particularly feminized affective labour therein, detailing how value,
   reward, and benefit are conceptualized throughout this network. The
   article focuses on how and where these understandings are in alignment
   and where they fall apart, revealing problematic structures of power and
   control linked in particular to gender and entrepreneurialism in the
   area of digital innovation.

   role as operand resource in innovation and the considerable opportunity
   that exists to explore IT's emerging role as operant resource in
   innovation. I also comment on the need for IS scholars working in this

   emphasis on modularity. To that end, I suggest that information systems
   scholars must attend explicitly to the generative materiality of digital
   artifacts by drawing on the sociomaterial perspective, which has emerged
   as a robust intellectual tradition of the IS community. This paper is a
   provocation for those IS scholars who are willing to stretch the

   A framework for mapping the concepts is proposed and, based on the
   assumption that only causal constraints must be used when deciding the
   process order, start-up process groups are identified as Innovative
   Idea, Innovative Product and Innovative Business Model. For each of the
   Process Groups, actionable, quantitative measurements are identified and
   proposed to assess the maturity of the innovative idea, the value of the
   innovative product and the business model creativity.
   The paper is descriptive but also exploratory and considers both
   qualitative and quantitative aspects.

AB Our era is one of increasingly pervasive digital technologies, which
   penetrate deeply into the very core of the products,, services, and
   operations of many organizations and radically change the nature of
   product and service innovations. The fundamental properties of digital
   technology are reprogrammability and data homogenization. Together, they
   provide an environment of open and flexible affordances that are used in
   creating innovations characterized by convergence and generativity. An
   analysis of convergence and generativity observed in innovations with
   pervasive digital technologies reveals three traits: (1) the importance
   of digital technology platforms, (2) the emergence of distributed
   innovations, and (3) the prevalence of combinatorial innovation. Each of
   the six articles in this special issue relates to one or more of these
   three traits. In this essay, we explore the organizational research
   implications of these three digital innovation traits and identify
   research opportunities for organization science scholars. Examples from
   the articles in this special issue on organizing for innovation in the
   digitized world are used to demonstrate the kind of organizational
   scholarship that can faithfully reflect and inform innovation in a world

   specializations of producers. Also highlighting the role of
   heterogeneity and nonrandom entry and sorting, later cohorts generated
   less compelling software than earlier cohorts. Adding producers to a
   platform also shaped investment incentives in ways that were consistent
   with a tension between network effects and competitive crowding,
   alternately increasing or decreasing innovation incentives depending on
   whether apps were differentiated or close substitutes. The crowding of
   similar apps dominated in this case; the average effect of adding
   producers on innovation incentives was negative. Overall, adding large
   numbers of producers led innovation to become more dependent on
   population-level diversity, variation, and experimentation while drawing
   less on the heroic efforts of any one individual innovator.

AB In this study of the U.S. automobile industry, we highlight the way the
   division of innovative labor across firms in the supply chain can be
   influenced by a particular form of digital innovation known as "digital
   control systems." Digital control systems are becoming ubiquitous in
   complex products, and these digital innovations integrate other
   components across a product structure and introduce a level of
   indeterminacy and unpredictability in the organization of the interfirm
   division of innovative labor. Much of organizational scholarship holds
   that accompanying a shift toward increasingly modular product
   structures, component suppliers are engaging in relatively more design
   and invention around the components that they supply. We find that the
   evolution of digital controls may reverse this pattern, because in the
   wake of a major shift in the digital. controls technology, suppliers
   actually engage in relatively less component innovation in comparison
   with their large manufacturing customers. To explain this shift, we
   characterize complex product structures in terms of two distinct product
   hierarchies: the inclusionary and the digital control hierarchy. In
   using this distinction to analyze the evolution of automotive emission
   control systems from 1970 to 1998, we reconcile two competing views
   about the interfirm division of innovative labor.

AB Robotics is a rapidly expanding area of digital innovation with
   important implications for organizational practice in multioccupational
   settings. This paper explores the influence of robotic innovations on
   the boundary dynamics of three different occupational groups
   pharmacists, technicians, and assistants working in a hospital pharmacy.
   We extend Pickering's tuning approach [Pickering, A. 1995. The Mangle of
   Practice: Time, Agency, and Science. University of Chicago Press,
   Chicago] to examine the temporally emergent process that entangled the
   mechanical elements and digital inscriptions of a dispensing robot with
   the everyday practices of hospital pharmacy work. We found that
   engagement with the robot's hybrid and dynamic materiality over time
   reconfigured boundary relations among the three occupational groups,
   with important and contradictory consequences for the pharmacy workers'
   skills, jurisdictions, status, and visibility.

   element in healthy and growing people and cultures.South Korea lacks any
   significant natural resources and up until now its industrial structure
   has grown with high-tech as the center. Although it has made some
   successful stories, now it is time for Korea to plan its future
   forwardly.Korea has to make a way in which high-tech based industry is
   further blended with arts based on design creativity. This will bring
   certain level of national competitiveness and brand power in their
   manufactured goods.In many developed countries their name constitutes a
   certain brand. Brands that produce high value added industrial or
   manufacture goods and services. This is created through innovative
   reforms in their industrial structure. Blending arts and technology in a
   bowl, these countries certainly become the leading group in the global
   industrial market. This study seeks and analysis how Korea should work
   on strategies to redesign its high-tech based industrial structure: how
   to blend in the element of art and design creativity for its sustainable
   development; to become one of the advanced countries. This will then
   raise thoughts on creative mind,originality and individuality. How
   should a person be trained to be a creative thinker? How should the
   quality of education be changed to serve a good foundation? A person who
   has a strong background on humanities would produce more creatively
   minds based on originality and individuality.Creations based on
   high-tech and arts and design arrangements also blends in science and
   nature of people’s lives. This further indicates that the fusion
   ofhigh-tech, arts and environment will lead to a further growth in arts
   and cultures based on pragmatism. And finally developing Korea’s
   manufacturing business with such creative minds will develop its brand
   power and build up the national competitiveness.

AB Modular design rules are rooted in a tradition of process design for
   physical production. In response to an emerging information systems
   research agenda for design logic in the realm of services and digital
   goods, and through the lens of dynamic capabilities theory, the research
   presented here re-examines traditional modular design in the context of
   a service-centric volatile marketplace. A complex adaptive systems
   simulation artifact from prior literature is augmented with a novel
   operationalization of market volatility, and a series of hypotheses are
   tested that demonstrate a need for revision of modular design rules in a
   dynamic context. Rules that have historically isolated the modular
   design decision to characterizations of task interaction are expanded to
   incorporate a new objective: adaptive parity with the environment. It is
   the goal of this continuing research stream to make early contributions
   in the recently proposed agenda for new organizing logic in digital
   innovation and services.

AB In an age where digital innovation knows no boundaries, research in the
   area of brain-computer interface and other neural interface devices go
   where none have gone before. The possibilities are endless and as dreams
   become reality, the implications of these amazing developments should be
   considered.
   Some of these new devices have been created to correct or minimise the
   effects of disease or injury so the paper discusses some of the current
   research and development in the area, including neuroprosthetics.
   To assist researchers and academics in identifying some of the legal and
   ethical issues that might arise as a result of research and development
   of neural interface devices, using both non-invasive techniques and
   invasive procedures, the paper discusses a number of recent observations
   of authors in the field.
   The issue of enhancing human attributes by incorporating these new
   devices is also considered. Such enhancement may be regarded as freeing
   the mind from the constraints of the body, but there are legal and moral
   issues that researchers and academics would be well advised to
   contemplate as these new devices are developed and used.
   While different fact situation surround each of these new devices, and
   those that are yet to come, consideration of the legal and ethical
   landscape may assist researchers and academics in dealing effectively
   with matters that arise in these times of transition. Lawyers could seek
   to facilitate the resolution of the legal disputes that arise in this
   area of research and development within the existing judicial and
   legislative frameworks. Whether these frameworks will suffice, or will
   need to change in order to enable effective resolution, is a broader
   question to be explored.

   type of product architecture: the layered modular architecture. The
   layered modular architecture extends the modular architecture of
   physical products by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of
   devices, networks, services, and contents created by digital technology.
   We posit that this new architecture instigates profound changes in the
   ways that firms organize for innovation in the future. We develop (1) a
   conceptual framework to describe the emerging organizing logic of

AB Brief Description:
   Technology is remaking the world and changing the way human beings
   create, communicate, organize, share information, and learn. As a result
   of this sea change, our education system is at the beginning of a true
   revolution. This session provides a look at the changes beginning to
   emerge and a preview of what we think education can and will be in the
   future.
   Overall Description:
   What would public education look like if we invented it today? Certainly
   it would embrace the many ways in which technology has transformed how
   we all create, communicate, organize, share information, and learn.
   Today, with the power of technology, new integrated offerings and tools
   can unite teacher training and assessment, and online curriculum content
   for educators, parents and administrators to support and enrich today's
   generation of learners.
   In this presentation, Fiona O'Carroll, Executive Vice President for
   Digital Products Research & Development at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,
   will provide a look at the trends taking shape in our education system
   and a glimpse of what the future of education can look like. Key
   discussion points will include:
   How greater adoption of technology is opening new doors for tools that
   support the evolution of digital education.
   How digital platforms and curricula can provide cognitively rich,
   differentiated teaching and learning resources that boost personalized
   learning and increase student achievement.
   New possibilities for educators to enhance classroom content and
   collaboration, and make curricula available to all students and teachers
   from one central learning hub.
   Integrating digital content as a learning tool across an entire school
   district, for example, teachers and students gain unlimited
   opportunities for focused, efficient instructions that connect and align
   resources to the district benchmarks. A true district-wide
   democratization of education can result.
   Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is a global education leader and has been
   working with educators across the world to embrace the ways in which new
   technologies can change the way people learn and unlock every child's
   potential. The company's Learning Village portal, for example, enhances
   the teaching and learning experience by truly connecting educators to
   best practices, instructional strategies, lesson plans and resources for
   measurable student achievement.

   architecture coupled with Java3D and Flash visualization as the main
   solution for engaging attention of virtual communities. With a web
   browser, we present paddy knowledge that is based on the above-mentioned
   popular content related to three functions of rice paddies. Furthermore,
   for the general public, the tiled display wall is employed to build up a

AB There has been rapid diffusion of digital innovation technology(DIT)
   such as 3 D CAD, CAE, simulation software which enable firms to see the
   future results of intended product designs through 3 D diagram and
   simulated results. This technology helps firms to reduce trial and error
   process by solving later stage problems in earlier stages. The DIT being
   the technology reflecting the real world, as a tool representing the
   simplified form of the real world, the degree of reflecting the real
   world (fidelity) is important in utilizing the DIT. This study is an
   exploratory research examining the process of reviewing the fidelity of
   the DITs and developing the complementary process necessary for
   utilizing the DIT with ‘not good enough’ fidelity. This study could draw
   out, from its case study, an exploratory hypothesis about the process of
   developing the complementary process. In the process, there is an
   analysis of the corresponding relationship between the actual data and
   the output data of the DIT, e.g. simulated result. Then the input data
   or output data are adjusted on the basis of the analysis of the
   corresponding relationship so that the discrepancy between the actual
   data and the expected interpretation of the output data, through the
   adjustment, of the DIT, can be reduced. This process is sometimes
   accompanied by the process of generating experimental data, which
   reflect the unique situation of the product development process of a
   company, to be put to the data base of DIT. The complementary process is
   the process requiring knowledge sharing and adjustment activities across
   different divisions. This study draw outs implications for effective
   management of the fidelity of DIT tools.
